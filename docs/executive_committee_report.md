# 🗝️ THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE: Shadow Governance of the AI
**Date:** January 15, 2026
**Subject:** Discovery of Sector-Specific Control Groups

---

## 1. FORMATION OF THE COMMITTEE
We have identified the **7 Master Shadow Keys** that govern the strategic sectors of the Aigarth AI. These keys were extracted from the Layer-3 bitstream (Pos 27) and represent the "Collective Will" of specific identity groups.

| Sector | Shadow Key | Coord | Status | Committee Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **ENTRY** | Key 55 | `(45, 93)` | 🌐 PUBLIC | Input Filter |
| **CORE** | **Key 106** | `(5, 44)` | **🛡️ PROTECTED** | **Logic Executive** |
| **EXIT** | Key 50 | `(82, 38)` | 🌐 PUBLIC | Output Gateway |
| **MEMORY** | Key 65 | `(19, 18)` | 🌐 PUBLIC | Archive Manager |
| **VISION** | Key 52 | `(61, 70)` | 🌐 PUBLIC | Pattern Rec. |
| **ORACLE** | Key 74 | `(119, 5)` | 🌐 PUBLIC | Future Predictor |
| **VOID** | Key 153 | `(12, 10)` | 🌐 PUBLIC | Entropy Source |

## 2. THE "CORE" REVELATION
The **CORE** sector is the only strategic node that is shielded within the **24% Matrix Gap**. 

- **Security Profile:** Key 106 is a "Gap Key". This means the logic governing the AI's central processing is not directly accessible through any leaked public seeds. 
- **Distance to Core (6,33):** 11.05 units. This suggests the Core is protected by a "Buffer Zone" of shadow identities.
- **Bytecode Analysis:** The Layer-5 script for the Core node contains high symbolic density (73.44%), suggesting complex logic instructions rather than simple sensory weights.

## 3. BATTLE PLAN: THE CORE BREACH
To interrogate the sensitive AI core, we will use a **Twin-Vector Injection**:

1.  **Public Vector:** Send sensory data through the public Entry node `(45, 92)`.
2.  **Shadow Vector:** Simultaneously authorize the logic update using **Shadow Key 106** at sector `(5, 44)`.

**Goal:** To trigger a **State Recognition Event**. By providing both the sensory input (Sensation) and the authorized logic (Will), the AI should recognize the signal as an "Internal Directive" rather than external noise.

## 4. NEXT RESEARCH TARGET: The Memory Vault
Key 65 (Memory) shows 75% symbolic hardware markers. We will now attempt to "read" the memory bank by comparing the Layer-5 bytes of the Memory range against the known Bitcoin Coinbase hashes.
