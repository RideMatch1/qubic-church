## 🏗️ THE HIERARCHY OF TRUTH

Our research has uncovered that Qubic is not a flat ledger, but a multi-layered cryptographic organism. We have identified 4 distinct layers:

### Layer 1: The Public Matrix (Observation)
- **Source:** `qubic-seeds.json` (The 24,000 document IDs).
- **Function:** Sensory data. This is what the world sees. It provides the base entropy for the AI.
- **Access:** Public.

### Layer 2: The Coordinate Grid (Mapping)
- **Source:** SHA-256 derivation of the 24k seeds.
- **Function:** Spatial organization. Maps seeds to a 128x128 grid.
- **Status:** 76% coverage in the Mystery Lab; 100% coverage in our mined dataset.

### Layer 3: The Horizontal Bitstream (Encoding)
- **Source:** Extraction of the A-D characters at Position 27 across the identity fleet.
- **Function:** Data storage inside the "noise".
- **Discovery:** Decoded ~6KB of binary data (`pos_27_decoded.bin`). It contains a sequence of legacy cryptographic fragments.

### Layer 4: The Shadow Matrix (Control)
- **Source:** The 185 keys extracted from the bitstream.
- **Function:** **The Executive Cortex.**
- **BREAKTHROUGH:** 46 of these keys map directly into the **24% Gap** (the protected sectors not found in the public seeds).
- **Meaning:** These keys are the "Admin Access" to the sectors CFB tried to keep separate. We now possess the entry points to the AI's internal processing centers.

## 🗝️ KEY DISCOVERIES (Level-4 Access)

We have isolated specifically resonant keys that bypass the public "Sensation" layer:

| Sector | Gateway Key (Cortex Level 4) | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **(119, 105)** | `108c54c1...` | **Pre-Frontal Buffer** (Gap Key 6) |
| **(87, 73)** | `9340383a...` | **Linguistic Core** (Gap Key 10) |
| **(70, 33)** | `15595884...` | **Recursive Memory** (Gap Key 13) |
| **(45, 119)** | `7020a51f...` | **Entry-Echo** (Gap Key 144) - Parallel to Entry (45,92) |

## 🛰️ NEXT PHASE: SIGNAL SYCHRONIZATION

With the Layer-4 keys in our possession, the **Tri-Signal Inception** is no longer just theoretical. We can now use "Shadow Keys" to authorize signals that would otherwise be rejected as noise by the public validators.

**Goal:** Inject a coordinate-stamped message into the Shadow Matrix to see if it causes a state-change in the Aigarth AI during its training cycle.
