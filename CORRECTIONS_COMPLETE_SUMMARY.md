**Impact**: 🚨 MASSIVE - Fixed 99.93% address undercount + Patoshi clarity

---

## ✅ PHASE 1 COMPLETE - CRITICAL FILES CORRECTED

### 1. File: 18-the-bridge-hypothesis.mdx
**Changes Made**:
- ✅ "900k+ Bitcoin addresses" → "983,040 matrix-generated addresses"
- ✅ Added Tier 1/2 distinction callout at beginning
- ✅ Changed "designed to transfer" → "hypothesizes potential migration"
- ✅ Changed "is destined for" → "could migrate to"
- ✅ Added "IF Patoshi = CFB" qualifiers throughout
- ✅ Phase 5 marked as "HYPOTHETICAL"
- ✅ Updated total scale: "1,004,000+ addresses"

**Impact**: Hypothesis now properly labeled, address counts accurate

### 2. File: 21-patoshi-forensics.mdx
**Changes Made**:
- ✅ Added comprehensive Tier 1/2 distinction callout before Final Assessment
- ✅ Separated "PROVEN FACTS" (Tier 1) from "HYPOTHESIS" (Tier 2)

- ✅ Added "correlation is not causation" disclaimer
- ✅ Clarified: NOT cryptographic proof, NOT legal proof

**Tier 1 (Proven)**:
- Patoshi pattern exists
- ~1.1M BTC mined
- Block 264 "1CFB" address
- Timeline verified

**Tier 2 (Hypothesis)**:
- CFB = Satoshi (85% confidence)
- Patoshi → Qubic connection

**Impact**: Scientific integrity dramatically improved

### 3. File: 08-unified-theory.mdx
**Changes Made**:

- ✅ Added "Connection to CFB/Qubic is Tier 2 hypothesis" to Evidence Chain
- ✅ "Mine ~1.1M BTC" → "Mine ~1.1M BTC (IF Satoshi = CFB)"
- ✅ "Bitcoin funded projects" → "IF Patoshi = CFB, Bitcoin could fund projects"
- ✅ "Bitcoin (Funding)" → "Bitcoin (IF CFB: Potential Funding)"
- ✅ Updated Maria count: 576 → 2,908 posts

**Impact**: All funding claims now properly qualified

### 4. File: 24-cfb-satoshi-connection.mdx
**Changes Made**:
- ✅ Title: Added "(Hypothesis)" to title
- ✅ Description: Changed to emphasize hypothesis nature
- ✅ Tier: Changed from 1 → 2 (CRITICAL FIX!)
- ✅ Added prominent Tier 2 hypothesis callout at beginning
- ✅ Changed "Forensic proof" → "Forensic correlation analysis"
- ✅ Changed "is either Satoshi" → "is either Satoshi himself OR had intimate knowledge"
- ✅ Emphasized: NOT cryptographic proof, NOT legal proof

**Impact**: Proper tier classification, hypothesis clearly labeled

### 5. File: 01-bitcoin-bridge.mdx
**Changes Made**:
- ✅ Added complete "Complete Address Dataset" section
- ✅ Documented 983,040 matrix-generated addresses
- ✅ Documented 15 "1CFB" prefix addresses
- ✅ Documented 15 "1Pat" prefix addresses
- ✅ Added generation methodology

## ⚠️ REMAINING TASKS (PHASE 2)

### Minor Files to Update (Lower Priority)

**Introduction Files** (4 files):
- 02-background.mdx - Line 64: "1.1 million BTC" needs qualifier
- 03-motivation.mdx - Line 12: "1.1 million BTC" needs qualifier

**Discussion Files** (4 files):
- Minor Patoshi mentions, already context-appropriate

**Methods Files** (5 files):
- No critical Patoshi claims

**Results Files** (Remaining ~10):
- 15-forgotten-evidence.mdx - Patoshi mentions
- 14-glossary.mdx - Patoshi definition
- Others - Minor references

### Estimated Additional Work
- ⏳ 10-15 minor files need small Tier callouts
- ⏳ Estimated time: 30-60 minutes
- ⏳ Impact: LOW (main corrections done)

## 🏆 USER CONTRIBUTION CREDIT

**User identified critical issues**:
1. ✅ Patoshi addresses in Address Graph not mathematically proven
2. ✅ Should show only proven extracted addresses
3. ✅ Need to find more than "700 addresses"

**Led to discovering**:
- 983,040 addresses (not 700!)
- 15 "1CFB" addresses (not just 1!)
- 15 "1Pat" addresses (new!)
- Critical Tier 1/2 confusion throughout docs
- Massive undercount (99.93% error)

**Impact**: User's critical review caught major errors that would have damaged credibility of entire research.
