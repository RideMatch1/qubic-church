# Statistical Rigor

## Purpose

This section provides detailed documentation of the statistical methodology employed in this research, including explicit discussion of assumptions, limitations, and proper interpretation guidelines.

## Confidence Tier System

All claims in this documentation are classified according to the following tier system:

### Tier Definitions

| Tier | Label | Criteria | Example |
|------|-------|----------|---------|
| **Tier 1** | Verified | Directly computable, deterministic | `1221069728 % 121 = 43` |
| **Tier 2** | Supported | Statistical test p < 0.01 | Chi-squared rejection of uniform distribution |
| **Tier 3** | Plausible | Consistent with hypothesis, p < 0.05 | Code style pattern matching |
| **Tier 4** | Speculative | Logical inference, not statistically tested | Common authorship claims |

### Application Guidelines

- **Tier 1** claims can be independently verified with a calculator
- **Tier 2** claims require statistical computation but produce reproducible results
- **Tier 3** claims involve interpretation and should be treated as suggestive
- **Tier 4** claims are hypotheses for further investigation, not conclusions

## Independence Assumptions

### The Critical Caveat

The combined probability calculations (e.g., "1 in 250 trillion") rely on the assumption that individual findings are statistically independent. This assumption may not hold.

### Sources of Potential Correlation

| Finding Pair | Potential Correlation Source |
|--------------|------------------------------|
| Timestamp mod 121 ↔ Cluster gap | Both involve same blockchain |
| Matrix cell values ↔ 27-div sums | Both derived from Anna Matrix |
| Dead key positions ↔ Block heights | Dead keys are a subset of blocks |

### Impact on Combined Probability

| Assumption | Combined P-value | Interpretation |
|------------|------------------|----------------|
| Full independence | ~10⁻¹⁴ | Upper bound on evidence strength |
| 50% correlation | ~2×10⁻⁸ | Conservative estimate |
| High correlation | ~10⁻⁴ | Most conservative |

**Recommendation**: Evaluate individual findings rather than relying solely on combined probabilities.

## Multiple Testing Correction

### The Problem

When testing many hypotheses, some will appear significant by chance alone. With 100 tests at α = 0.05, we expect ~5 false positives.

### Corrections Applied

| Method | Formula | Application |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Bonferroni | α_adjusted = α / n | Conservative, used for primary claims |
| Benjamini-Hochberg | FDR control | Used for exploratory analysis |

### Adjusted Thresholds

For n = 20 primary tests at α = 0.05:

```
α_adjusted = 0.05 / 20 = 0.0025
```

Findings must achieve p < 0.0025 to be considered significant after correction.

### Current Findings After Correction

| Finding | Unadjusted p | Adjusted Threshold | Status |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|--------|
| Pre-Genesis mod 121 = 43 | 0.00033 | 0.0025 | **Significant** |
| Cluster gap = 43.5 | ~0.0001 | 0.0025 | **Significant** |
| Double 16 convergence | 0.004 | 0.0025 | Marginal |
| 27-div sum = 0xB1 | ~0.00001 | 0.0025 | **Significant** |

## Alternative Explanations

### Null Hypothesis Alternatives

For each finding, we consider alternative explanations:

#### Finding: Timestamp mod 121 = 43

| Explanation | Probability Assessment |
|-------------|----------------------|
| Random coincidence | 1/121 = 0.83% |
| Intentional design | Unknown prior |
| Post-hoc selection | If 121 was chosen because it worked, p increases |

**Mitigating Factor**: 121 = 11² has independent significance in Qubic architecture.

#### Finding: Dead Key Non-Uniform Distribution

| Explanation | Probability Assessment |
|-------------|----------------------|
| Mining difficulty changes | Would not explain clustering |
| Hardware availability | Possible but doesn't match pattern |
| Intentional placement | Consistent with observations |

### Selection Bias Considerations

| Potential Bias | Mitigation |
|----------------|------------|
| Choosing "significant" moduli | Pre-specified based on Qubic architecture |
| Selecting favorable block ranges | Using complete early blockchain (0-50,000) |
| Cherry-picking matrix cells | Using algorithmic mapping, not manual selection |

## Sample Size Considerations

### Current Limitations

| Dataset | Sample Size | Statistical Power |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Dead Key blocks | n = 53 | Moderate |
| Cluster gaps | n = 6 | Low |
| 27-divisible blocks | n = 4 | Very low |

### Implications

- Small sample sizes increase uncertainty
- Effect sizes may be overestimated
- Results should be replicated with larger datasets where possible

## Effect Size Analysis

### Beyond P-Values

Statistical significance alone does not indicate practical importance. We also report effect sizes:

| Finding | Effect Size | Interpretation |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| Dead key clustering | Cramer's V = 0.49 | Large effect |
| Timestamp alignment | Not applicable (exact match) | - |
| Matrix correlation | r = 0.23 | Small-medium effect |

## Falsifiability

### What Would Falsify the Design Hypothesis?

| Observation | Impact |
|-------------|--------|
| Alternative explanation for mod 121 = 43 | Weakens Tier 1 finding |
| Dead keys follow mining difficulty curve | Explains non-uniformity naturally |
| Matrix values are randomly generated | Undermines correlation claims |
| No additional correlations in extended analysis | Suggests cherry-picking |

### Pre-Registered Predictions

For future validation:

1. **Prediction 1**: March 12, 2026 will show mathematical significance (17.5 years from Pre-Genesis)
2. **Prediction 2**: Additional hash bytes will correlate with matrix structures
3. **Prediction 3**: Extended block analysis (50,000-100,000) will show continued patterns

## Interpretation Guidelines

### What the Evidence Supports

- Mathematical correlations exist between Bitcoin and Qubic data structures
- These correlations are unlikely to be purely random (p < 0.01 for multiple findings)
- The pattern is consistent with intentional design

### What the Evidence Does Not Prove

- Identity of any individual
- Causal relationship between projects
- Future behavior of any system

### Recommended Citation Language

**Strong**: "Statistical analysis reveals correlations that are unlikely to be coincidental (p < 0.001)."

**Moderate**: "The evidence is consistent with intentional design, though alternative explanations exist."

**Avoid**: "This proves that..." or "It is certain that..."

## Peer Review Status

| Component | Status | Reviewer |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Statistical calculations | Internal review | Complete |
| Methodology | Internal review | Complete |
| External peer review | **Pending** | Invited |

## Conclusion

This research employs rigorous statistical methodology while acknowledging inherent limitations. The evidence supports the hypothesis of intentional design but does not constitute proof. Readers should:

1. Evaluate individual findings independently
2. Consider alternative explanations
3. Await external peer review
4. Apply appropriate skepticism to combined probability claims

The goal of this documentation is transparent presentation of evidence for independent evaluation, not advocacy for a predetermined conclusion.
