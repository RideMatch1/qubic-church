## Executive Summary

| # | Claim | Original Status | Validated Status | Corrected p-value |
|---|-------|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| 1 | POCC+HASV combined pattern | p = 2.05e-8 | **SIGNIFICANT** | p = 2.05e-8 |
| 2 | Block mapping sum = 177 | p less than 0.001 | MARGINAL | p = 0.021 |
| 3 | Timestamp mod 121 = 43 | p = 0.00826 | NOT SIGNIFICANT | p = 1.0 |
| 4 | 15 "1CFB" prefix addresses | p = 0.000245 | NOT SIGNIFICANT | p = 1.0 |
| 5 | P less than 10^-500 collision | less than 10^-500 | **FABRICATED** | p less than 0.001 |
| 6 | Block 576 byte 0x1b | Claimed | **CONFIRMED** (unique in sample) | Needs base rate |
| 6b | Block 576 hash | Documented | **WRONG HASH** | N/A |
| 6c | Block 576 combined conditions | p = 7.8e-6 | INVALID | N/A |
| 7 | Bayesian 99.6% posterior | 99.6% | MISLEADING | 2%-99.9% |
| 8 | March 3, 2026 prediction | 6 convergences | **PENDING** (date not yet reached) | N/A |

**POCC+HASV pattern and Block 576 0x1b byte are the only confirmed findings.** The documented Block 576 hash is wrong. Everything else is either not significant, fabricated, or pending (March 3, 2026).

## WS0: Data Integrity (Foundation)

All data files passed integrity checks:

| File | Records | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| anna-matrix.json | 128x128 = 16,384 cells | PASS (99.58% symmetry confirmed) |
| patoshi-addresses.json | 21,953 | PASS (valid pubkey format) |
| bitcoin-derived-addresses.json | 20,955 | PASS (100% valid Base58) |
| qubic-seeds.json | 23,765 | PASS (all valid 55-char seeds) |
| anna-collision-analysis.json | 897 responses | FLAGGED (fabricated P-value) |

**Critical finding**: qubic-seeds.json source is `checksum_identities_batch_0.js` -- these are generated test identities, not real Qubic addresses.

## WS1: Blockchain Verification

### Block 576 Coinbase Analysis (Blockchain-Verified)

**H1.1**: Block 576 coinbase scriptSig contains byte 0x1b (decimal 27) -- **CONFIRMED**

The coinbase scriptSig is `04ffff001d021b06` (8 bytes). Byte 0x1b appears at position 6 as part of the extra nonce field. This is verifiable on the Bitcoin blockchain via blockstream.info API.

**H1.2**: Block 576 is the ONLY block (out of 54 sampled from blocks 1-1000) with 0x1b in its coinbase scriptSig -- **CONFIRMED**

This is genuinely unusual. However, the 0x1b byte is in the extra nonce position, which varies during mining. Its presence is a mining artifact, not necessarily intentional.

**H1.3**: The documented Block 576 hash is **INCORRECT**
- Documented prefix: `000000005f7e0f4f8e39...`
- Actual hash: `000000002436274e351576ee5c9d6a96ce64072d02713d20c32c36bf70f9fbb5`
- These do NOT match. The documented hash appears fabricated.

**Coinbase details**: TX `40c1585c90e2081d6e14e60952c16258b3ae2fed204d0879fda052572d03c705`, scriptSig bytes: [4, 255, 255, 0, 29, 2, 27, 6]

### Timestamp Verification

**H1.4**: 1221069728 % 121 = 43 -- **CONFIRMED** (trivially verifiable arithmetic)

**H1.5**: Timestamp = 2008-09-10, exactly 115 days before Genesis -- **CONFIRMED**

**H1.6**: Statistical significance -- **NOT SIGNIFICANT**

The critical issue: Was divisor 121 chosen post-hoc? Testing all divisors 2-200 against the timestamp:

- **21 divisors** produce "interesting" remainders
- **3 divisors** (55, 121, 191) produce remainder 43 specifically
- After Bonferroni correction for 199 divisors: **p = 1.0 (NOT SIGNIFICANT)**

The choice of 121 = 11^2 has a narrative connection to Qubic (11 quorum members), but this is post-hoc reasoning.

### Block Mapping Validation

**H1.7/H1.8/H1.9**: All documented block-to-matrix mappings are correct. The 4 blocks (3996, 10611, 16065, 36153) map to documented coordinates, values match [85, 60, 100, -68], and sum = 177 = 0xB1.

**Control C1**: Testing 10 other divisors (13, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53):
- **4 out of 11 divisors** produce "notable" hex byte sums
- Divisor 27 is NOT special compared to alternatives

**Control C2**: 10,000 random block sets with divisor 27:
- Sum = 177 occurs in 0.19% of simulations (P = 0.0019)
- After Bonferroni for 11 tested divisors: **p = 0.021 (marginal)**

**Control C3**: Base rate -- 4 random matrix cells sum to 177 with P = 0.0016, regardless of block mapping. The mapping itself adds almost no significance.

**Additional finding**: 576 is NOT divisible by 27 (576 mod 27 = 9). The "27-divisible block" mapping does not even apply to Block 576 itself.

## WS2: Address Prefix Analysis

### Base Rate Calculation

P("1CFB" prefix | starts with "1") = 1/58^3 = 1/195,112

For 983,040 addresses: Expected count = 5.04, Observed = 15, Ratio = 3.0x

### Poisson Test

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Uncorrected p (Poisson tail) | 0.000245 |
| Bonferroni correction | x 195,112 possible prefixes |
| **Corrected p** | **1.0 (NOT SIGNIFICANT)** |

This is a classic **look-elsewhere effect**. With 195,112 possible 4-character prefixes, finding one that appears 3x expected is unremarkable.

### Empirical Verification

In the 20,955 derived addresses: only **1** "1CFB" address found (expected: 0.107). The top prefix ("15TC") appears 5 times -- far more frequent than "1CFB".

In the full 983,040 matrix-addresses.json: grep confirms 15 "1CFB" occurrences, matching the documented claim. But this is not statistically significant after Bonferroni correction.

## WS3: K12 Derivation Analysis

### Address Format Validation

- All 20,955 addresses are valid Base58Check format (100%)
- Three methods (sha256, k12, qubic) each produce 6,985 addresses
- Each method produces **different** addresses for the same seed (confirmed)
- All addresses are unique (no duplicates)

### Private Key Format

- All private keys are 64-character hex strings (256-bit)
- SHA256(seed) does NOT directly match stored private keys -- additional derivation steps exist
- Full reproduction requires secp256k1 library (not available in stdlib)

### Seed Provenance

The 23,765 seeds come from `checksum_identities_batch_0.js` -- these are generated test seeds, not addresses found on the Qubic network. Each seed record includes `documentedIdentity` and `realIdentity` with a `match` field -- this was a checksum verification exercise, not a bridge discovery.

## WS4: Probability Claims Audit

### Master Correction Table

| Claim | Original | Honest Value | Correction Factor | Status |
|-------|----------|-------------|-------------------|--------|
| Collision P-value | less than 10^-500 | p less than 0.001 | greater than 10^497 | **FABRICATED** |
| Timestamp mod 121 | p = 0.00826 | p = 1.0 | 121x (Bonferroni) | NOT SIGNIFICANT |
| Block mapping sum | p less than 0.001 | p = 0.021 | 11x (Bonferroni) | MARGINAL |
| "1CFB" prefix | p = 0.000245 | p = 1.0 | 195,112x (Bonferroni) | NOT SIGNIFICANT |
| POCC+HASV | p = 2.05e-8 | p = 2.05e-8 | 1x (validated) | **SIGNIFICANT** |
| Block 576 conditions | p = 7.8e-6 | N/A | N/A | INVALID (not independent) |
| Bayesian posterior | 99.6% | 2% - 99.9% | Prior-dependent | MISLEADING |
| March 3 prediction | 6 convergences | 3 independent | N/A | **PENDING** |

### Bayesian Sensitivity Analysis

The documented 99.6% posterior for P(Design | Evidence) is highly sensitive to prior assumptions:

| Prior P(Design) | Using POCC+HASV evidence | Using weakened evidence |
|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|
| 0.001 (very skeptical) | 99.99% | 4.8% - 9.0% |
| 0.01 (skeptical) | 99.99% | 33.6% - 50.0% |
| 0.05 (neutral) | 99.99% | 72.5% - 83.9% |
| 0.10 (sympathetic) | 100.0% | 84.7% - 91.7% |

With the strongest evidence (POCC+HASV alone), the Bayesian posterior IS high regardless of prior. But this reflects the POCC+HASV finding, not the broader "bridge" hypothesis.

### March 3, 2026: Dependency Analysis

The "6 independent convergences" actually share only 3 independent pieces of information:
1. The number 576 (gives you 24^2, MT576, and Genesis message for free)
2. The number 121 = 11^2 (gives you timestamp mod for free)
3. Qubic Epoch 43

The prediction date (March 3, 2026) has not yet been reached. As of February 6, 2026, 25 days remain.

## WS5: Exploratory Testing

### Value -113 Collision

- Value -113 appears 147 times in the matrix (0.90%)
- P(3 random cells all = -113) = 1 in 1,384,547
- P(3 cells match ANY value) = 1 in 8,837
- **246 out of 256 values** would produce "impressive" 3-way collisions
- **Verdict**: Look-elsewhere effect. The -113 collision is not special.

### POCC/HASV Position Mapping

Tested 4 mapping methods (character value, SHA256 hash, cumulative sum, matrix walk):
- POCC and HASV z-scores are within normal range for all methods
- POCC asymmetric column hits: 0 (expected: 1.9)
- HASV asymmetric column hits: 1 (expected: 1.9)
- **Verdict**: No special mapping properties found. POCC/HASV addresses behave like random addresses when mapped to the matrix.

## What Survives?

### Genuinely Significant

1. **POCC+HASV combined pattern** (p = 2.05e-8, 1 in 48.8 million)
   - Validated with Monte Carlo + Bonferroni in previous session
   - Survives all corrections
   - This IS statistically remarkable

### Genuinely Interesting (Design Properties)

2. **Anna Matrix 99.58% point symmetry** (p less than 10^-6)
   - Genuine but explained: neural network E/I balance by design
3. **68 asymmetric cells in 4 column pairs**
   - Genuine structural feature for symmetry breaking
4. **60 neuron types with mirror-paired dominance**
   - Real neural architecture, not a "bridge"

### Not Significant After Correction

5. Timestamp mod 121 = 43
6. "1CFB" prefix count
7. Block mapping sum = 177 (marginal)
8. Value -113 collision

### Pending Verification

9. March 3, 2026 prediction (date not yet reached)

### Falsified

10. CFB = Satoshi claim (explicitly denied by CFB)

### Fabricated

11. "P less than 10^-500" collision claim

## Conclusion

The Bitcoin-Qubic Bridge hypothesis, as originally documented, is **largely unsupported** by honest statistical analysis. The vast majority of claimed "connections" are:

1. **Post-hoc pattern matching** (choosing parameters that fit, then computing probabilities)
2. **Look-elsewhere effects** (reporting the most impressive finding from many tests)
3. **Non-independent conditions** (counting the same information multiple times)
4. **Fabricated statistics** (the 10^-500 claim has no mathematical basis)

**The one genuine finding** -- the POCC+HASV combined pattern at 1 in 48.8 million -- is real and deserves investigation. But it does not support the broader "bridge" narrative of deliberate Bitcoin-Qubic integration.

The Anna Matrix is a genuine engineered artifact (a pre-trained neural network weight matrix), but its purpose is **computational** (Aigarth neural processing), not **cryptographic** (Bitcoin bridge).
