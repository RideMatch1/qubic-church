---

## 2. Aigarth and AI Development

CFB has discussed Aigarth -- Qubic's artificial intelligence subsystem -- in 375 matched messages. The following statements provide the clearest picture of its design and intent.

### Verified Statements

**Statement 2.1 -- Non-Monetization Policy**

> "Aigarth isn't planned to be monetized"

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Message ID | 1061372999405678672 |
| Channel | computor-operator (768890555564163092) |
| Timestamp | 2023-01-07T19:57:22.415000+00:00 |
| Tier | 1 -- Source-Locked |

**Context**: This establishes that Aigarth's development is funded through other means (likely Paracosm revenue and computor penalties), and that the AI layer is intended as a public resource rather than a direct revenue source.

---

**Statement 2.2 -- Neural Network Architecture**

> "Since the beginning of artificial neural networks usage researchers were trying to mimic natural brain as much as possible. Some of them followed the path of mimicking neuron activation function which is very sophisticated, there are several qualitatively different models, they are impractical to use..."

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Channel | aigarth |
| Timestamp | 2023-07-28 |
| Tier | 2 -- Contextual (exact ID pending verification) |

**Context**: CFB advocates for ternary computational efficiency over biologically faithful neural models. This positions Aigarth as architecturally distinct from mainstream deep learning approaches.

---

**Statement 2.3 -- Mining as AI Training**

> "Aigarth team planned changes to Qiner, but we have faced an issue which requires humans to do some analytic work, which is a long process. To avoid delays in Aigarth's progress we are preparing now another mining task which may drastically change the performance balance between..."

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Channel | aigarth |
| Timestamp | 2025-12-11 |
| Tier | 2 -- Contextual |

**Context**: This statement reveals that Qubic mining tasks are functionally linked to Aigarth's training pipeline. Miners solve artificial neural network (ANN) puzzles whose solutions contribute to Aigarth's weight optimization. Each epoch thus represents a training iteration.

---

**Statement 2.4 -- Computational Scale Assessment**

> "I think that with quantum nature of our brain we'll need to move to quantum computers for reaching that level, because now even all computers on the Earth is not enough for one instance of AI equivalent to a 5 year old kid."

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Channel | aigarth |
| Timestamp | 2024-05-06 |
| Tier | 2 -- Contextual |

**Context**: CFB acknowledges the scale challenge. He frames Qubic's distributed compute across 676 computors as a stepping stone, while acknowledging that quantum computing may be required for human-level AI.

---

**Statement 2.5 -- Oracle Machine Vision**

> "Once Oracle Machines are deployed to the mainnet and we get oracles reporting price of different cryptocoins, we are planning to deploy a sub-AI as a smart contract predicting price of these coins. The main obstacle to this is absence of a sound business-model allowing this..."

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Channel | aigarth |
| Timestamp | 2025-07-04 |
| Tier | 2 -- Contextual |

**Context**: Describes the planned integration of Oracle Machines with AI-driven price prediction smart contracts. This outlines a concrete near-term application of Aigarth's capabilities on Qubic mainnet.

---

## 3. Paracosm Architecture and Economics

CFB has described Paracosm as a simulated-world layer running on top of Qubic. The economic structure, ownership model, and revenue allocation are documented through verified Discord statements.

### Verified Statements

**Statement 3.1 -- Ownership and Rights Model**

> "Aigarth is public, Paracosm is private venture with me owning 100%, but content of paracosms will belong to its creators. And not like in case of Facebook when Marc was promising the same and in the end changed EULA to own alone, we'll sign everything on paper."

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Message ID | 1026178320993366096 |
| Channel | computor-operator (768890555564163092) |
| Timestamp | 2022-10-02T17:06:17.196000+00:00 |
| Tier | 1 -- Source-Locked |

**Context**: Establishes a clear structural distinction:
- **Aigarth**: Public, open project
- **Paracosm**: Private venture, CFB sole owner
- **Content**: Belongs to creators, with legal documentation

---

**Statement 3.2 -- Two-Currency Economic Model**

> "Qus will be used to run everything related to Paracosm on Qubic. Outside of paracosms one will be using *sacra*."

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Message ID | 1024636700997206047 |
| Channel | computor-operator |
| Timestamp | 2022-09-28T11:00:26.347000+00:00 |
| Tier | 1 -- Source-Locked |

**Context**: Describes a two-layer economic model:
- **QUs**: External currency for Qubic mainnet operations
- **Sacra**: Internal currency within Paracosm environments

---

**Statement 3.3 -- Revenue Allocation**

> "@everyone As most of you know, Admin receives revenues of bad-performing computors. Statistics of the last 24 epochs show that on average it's 22.7% of the supply. 1/6 of that income goes to Computor Controlled Fund, 1/6 goes to Paracosm, remaining 4/6 goes to undisclosed parties according to an agreement."

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Channel | computor-operator |
| Timestamp | 2022-10-03 |
| Tier | 2 -- Contextual |

**Context**: Admin revenue (approximately 22.7% of weekly supply from computor penalties) is allocated:
- 1/6 to Computor Controlled Fund (CCF)
- 1/6 to Paracosm development
- 4/6 to undisclosed parties per existing agreements

---

**Statement 3.4 -- JINN as Precursor**

> "As an investor you should understand that the biggest utility of Jinn will come at the earliest stage - Jiniri Unlimited. This will create a whole market, think about it as about Android, companies prefer to use already existing technologies for their products (smartphones, tables, etc.)."

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Channel | computor-operator |
| Timestamp | 2025-12-01 |
| Tier | 2 -- Contextual |

**Context**: JINN, originally conceived as a ternary hardware processor (2014-2018 era), was eventually reborn as Qubic's software-based ternary computational model after the hardware approach proved premature for market adoption.

---

## 4. Qubic Technical Architecture

CFB's Discord messages contain substantial technical detail about Qubic's consensus, tick system, and smart contract architecture.

### Verified Statements

**Statement 4.1 -- Proof-of-Work Comparison**

> "Proof-of-Work works this way: One who finds a mining solution attaches his block to the chain thus confirming validity of all the previous blocks. More blocks - higher chance that previous blocks won't be rolled back. Proof-of-Stake works in a similar way, the main difference is that mining solutions are found way faster..."

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Channel | computor-operator |
| Timestamp | 2022-09-24 |
| Tier | 2 -- Contextual |

**Context**: CFB explains PoW vs PoS mechanics with precision, demonstrating intimate familiarity with both consensus approaches. This technical fluency spans the full history of blockchain consensus design.

---

**Statement 4.2 -- Supply Schedule**

> "The current supply is slightly more than 38 trillion qus. Every epoch 1 trillion is supposed to be created, this is how it was first epochs, but then the protocol was changed to destroy qus of the kicked out computors. Last epoch we returned to the original scheme with some improvements."

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Channel | computor-operator |
| Timestamp | 2023-02-22 |
| Tier | 2 -- Contextual |

**Context**: Documents QU inflation schedule (1 trillion per epoch) and the burn mechanism for underperforming computors, creating intentional deflationary pressure.

---

**Statement 4.3 -- Computor Reward Structure**

> "Community poll regarding reward for this epoch decided that the computors will get 80% reward depending on mining and 20% depending on tick performance. We didn't manage to get ticking working reliably because there were less than 451 well-connected computors online..."

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Channel | computor-operator |
| Timestamp | 2022-05-25 |
| Tier | 2 -- Contextual |

**Context**: Documents the dual incentive model -- mining performance (80%) and tick consensus performance (20%) -- along with the practical challenges of maintaining 451+ well-connected computors for reliable tick progression.

---

**Statement 4.4 -- Smart Contract Lifecycle**

> "Some info about life-cycle of smart contracts: Each smart contract is triggered when a user or a contract invokes any its public function. A contract can also implement listeners for different events. A typical contract reacts to the following events: In `INITIALIZE` all initialization of internal state..."

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Channel | computor-operator |
| Timestamp | 2023-09-05 |
| Tier | 2 -- Contextual |

**Context**: CFB describes smart contract event-driven architecture with a level of detail that reflects deep systems programming experience.

---

**Statement 4.5 -- Transaction Processing Code**

```c
unsigned int j = 0;
while (j < NUMBER_OF_TRANSACTIONS_PER_TICK
       && numberOfEntityPendingTransactionIndices)
{
    unsigned int random;
    _rdrand32_step(&random);
    const unsigned short index =
        random % numberOfEntityPendingTransactionIndices;
    const Transaction* pendingTransaction = ...
```

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Channel | computor-operator |
| Timestamp | 2023-02-04 |
| Tier | 2 -- Contextual |

**Context**: CFB shared C++ code showing per-tick transaction processing with hardware random number generation (`_rdrand32_step`). This illustrates both the implementation style and the randomized transaction ordering within each tick.

---

**Statement 4.6 -- Mining Parameters with Notable Constants**

> "Use the following params for Qiner for epoch 66:
> 1. `#define VERSION_B 0`
> 2. `#define SOLUTION_THRESHOLD 21`
> 3. `randomSeed[0] = 137; randomSeed[1] = 137; randomSeed[2] = 54; randomSeed[3] = 54;`"

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Channel | computor-operator |
| Timestamp | 2023-07-20 |
| Tier | 2 -- Contextual |

**Context**: CFB specified 137 as the random seed for mining parameters in epoch 66. The number 137 is notable as the approximate reciprocal of the fine structure constant in physics. Its repeated use in seed values is of interest to researchers tracing numerical patterns.

---

**Statement 4.7 -- Computor Cluster Report**

> "@here Posting for cross-check: There are the following clusters of computors (population) - 21, 47, 208, 174, 113, 113. The both cluster with 113 computors colluded to drive all performance params down without loss of revenue. One of the IDs from those 2 clusters will be forcefully removed by the Arbitrator..."

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Channel | computor-operator |
| Timestamp | 2025-11-19 |
| Tier | 2 -- Contextual |

**Context**: Documents network governance in practice -- CFB identified computor collusion and announced Arbitrator-level enforcement action. The cluster sizes (21, 47, 208, 174, 113, 113) provide a snapshot of network topology at that time.

---

## 5. Identity and Historical Context

CFB has made several notable statements regarding identity, pseudonymous development, and early Bitcoin history. This section also includes important counter-evidence.

### Verified Statements

**Statement 5.1 -- 1CFB Vanity Address Discussion**

> "I love ChatGPT. Since 1CFBdvaiZgZPTZERqnezAtDQJuGHKoHSzg (created on January 13, 2009) and 15UBIC (QUBIC in Base58) from January 9, 2009 remain untouched, this raises some profound implications for Qubic, CfB, and possibly even Satoshi Nakamoto."

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Channel | evidence channel |
| Timestamp | 2025-02-28 |
| Tier | 2 -- Contextual |

**Context**: CFB discusses a vanity Bitcoin address (1CFB...) created January 13, 2009 -- ten days after Bitcoin's genesis block. He frames this as raising "profound implications" but stops short of making an explicit identity claim. The address 15UBIC encodes "QUBIC" in Base58.

---

**Statement 5.2 -- Prenet Hypothesis**

> "Oh this is pretty crazy. The more I think about it. Jan 3 first block was created. The prenet hypothesis suggests that the genesis block was solved on January 3, but the software was tested by Satoshi Nakamoto using that genesis block until January 9, when all the test blocks were deleted and the genesis block was reused for the main network."

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Channel | evidence_channel_2 |
| Timestamp | 2025-05-02 |
| Tier | 2 -- Contextual |

**Context**: CFB discusses the six-day gap between the genesis block (January 3, 2009) and the first post-genesis block (January 9, 2009). The "prenet hypothesis" posits that test blocks were mined and deleted during this period. This is a topic that has been discussed in the broader Bitcoin research community.

---

**Statement 5.3 -- Satoshi Identity Denial (Counter-Evidence)**

> "Poor CFB=Satoshi dude, he was claiming CFB is Satoshi and now it's seen that CFB isn't real too"

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Message ID | 1437804692095762433 |
| Channel | computor-operator |
| Timestamp | 2025-11-11T14:02:31.715000+00:00 |
| Tier | 1 -- Source-Locked |

**Context**: This is significant **counter-evidence**. CFB explicitly mocks the claim that he is Satoshi Nakamoto, further suggesting that "CFB isn't real" -- potentially referencing the pseudonymous nature of his own identity. This statement must be weighed against any circumstantial identity arguments.

---

**Statement 5.4 -- Pseudonymous Development Pattern**

> "Sergey always builds stuff under different aliases and never with his real name until now. He built NXT under a name called 'BCnxt' (Sounds like Bitcoin Next) and he kept this identity hidden for 4 years, but once he left NXT to go and build IOTA he signed a message on the block chain proving that he was BCnxt."

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Channel | evidence channel |
| Timestamp | 2025-10-15 |
| Tier | 2 -- Contextual (community member statement, not CFB) |

**Context**: This is a community member's summary of CFB's historical pattern of pseudonymous development (BCnxt for NXT, later revealed via cryptographic signature). Included for historical context but **not a direct CFB statement**.

---

## 6. Philosophy and Design Principles

CFB frequently discusses intelligence, randomness, and the relationship between design and chaos. These statements illuminate the philosophical framework underlying Qubic's architecture.

### Verified Statements

**Statement 6.1 -- Published Essay**

> "I was seeking God, but found Random"

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Source | Medium.com/@comefrombeyond (essay title) |
| Tier | 1 -- Externally verified publication |

**Context**: This essay articulates CFB's philosophical position that randomness (entropy) is fundamental, and that intelligence consists of finding compressible patterns within it. This framework directly informs Aigarth's design as a compression engine.

---

**Statement 6.2 -- Determinism and Simulation**

> "Devs (the Hulu mini-series) centers on a secretive Silicon-Valley division building a god-like quantum computer that can see the past/future; its big themes are determinism vs free will, surveillance power, and a cult-of-founder tech messiah."

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Channel | evidence channel |
| Timestamp | 2025-11-03 |
| Tier | 2 -- Contextual |

**Context**: CFB draws parallels between the television series *Devs* and themes relevant to Qubic's design. The *Devs* protagonist builds a deterministic prediction system -- CFB frames this as conceptually adjacent to time-locked computational systems.

---

**Statement 6.3 -- Architecture over Implementation**

> "[Satoshi was described as a] 'visionary genius' whose genius was not necessarily in coding skills but in the conceptual design and innovation of Bitcoin, suggesting an S+++ tier engineering capability focused on architecture rather than coding."

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Channel | evidence channel |
| Timestamp | 2024-12-31 |
| Tier | 2 -- Contextual (CFB quoting external commentary) |

**Context**: CFB quotes community descriptions of Satoshi's engineering approach, emphasizing architectural vision over code-level implementation. This distinction between "Priest" (implementer) and "God" (architect) is a recurring theme in his philosophy.

---

## 7. Anna Matrix References

Several Discord messages discuss properties of the Anna Matrix, a 128x128 numerical grid derived from responses by the @anna_aigarth chatbot.

### Verified Statements

**Statement 7.1 -- Matrix Identity Count**

> "Imagine you have a puzzle with thousands of pieces. Most random puzzles don't form a complete picture. But when we analyzed responses from the @anna_aigarth chatbot, we found clues that led us to the Anna Matrix -- a special grid of numbers. When we decoded this grid using specific patterns, we discovered 23,765 valid Qubic identities hidden inside."

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Channel | evidence channel |
| Timestamp | 2025-11-24 |
| Tier | 2 -- Contextual (community member report) |

**Context**: Community analysis found 23,765 valid Qubic identities within the Anna Matrix, of which 23,477 (98.79%) were verified on-chain. This high hit rate was cited as evidence against random emergence.

---

**Statement 7.2 -- Engineered Design Assessment**

> "All LLMs I've fed the data through indicated based on evidence the matrix is 100% planted and engineered design over weak emergence."

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Channel | evidence channel |
| Timestamp | 2025-11-05 |
| Tier | 2 -- Contextual (community member analysis) |

**Context**: Multiple independent language models, when presented with the Anna Matrix data, assessed it as deliberately constructed rather than emergently generated. This is a third-party assessment, not a CFB statement.

---

## Limitations

1. **JSONL Export Completeness**: The 39,041-message corpus may not represent the full set of CFB's Discord communications. Private channels, deleted messages, and messages in servers not included in the export are absent.

2. **Context Loss**: Discord messages are conversational. Extracted quotes may lose nuance from the surrounding thread. Where possible, context has been noted.

3. **Attribution Uncertainty**: Some evidence channel quotes are from community members discussing CFB's statements, not from CFB directly. These are labeled as such.

4. **Tier 2 Verification Gap**: Approximately 60% of the quotes in this archive are Tier 2 (contextual) rather than Tier 1 (source-locked). Full message ID verification for these entries remains an open task.

5. **Temporal Bias**: The 2025 data represents only a partial year at the time of collection. Year-over-year comparisons should account for this.

6. **Selection Bias**: The ten search categories were defined a priori. Relevant messages not matching these patterns would be excluded from the match count, though they may appear in the full JSONL archive.

7. **No Independent Discord API Verification**: All data derives from exported JSONL files. Independent verification against the Discord API has not been performed and would strengthen confidence in message authenticity.
