# Salomon Brothers Campaign: Irrefutable On-Chain Evidence

<Callout type="info" title="Verification Standard">
**Every claim in this document can be independently verified** using the Bitcoin blockchain.

Verification method: `curl https://blockstream.info/api/tx/{TXID}` or `curl https://blockstream.info/api/address/{ADDRESS}`

No proprietary data, no interpretations — pure on-chain facts.
</Callout>

<Summary>
On July 13, 2025, an entity operating under the name "Salomon Brothers" sent a legally-formatted "NOTICE TO OWNER" to dormant Bitcoin address `1CFBdvaiZgZPTZERqnezAtDQJuGHKoHSzg` — the same address that has been dormant since January 13, 2009. The notice is permanently recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain (Block 905378). The sender's wallet infrastructure is fully traceable. `1CFB` never responded.

This document presents the on-chain proof without speculation about identity.

## Section 1: The Primary Transaction (Tier 1 Proof)

### 1.1 The NOTICE TO OWNER — Exact Blockchain Data

<Evidence tier="1" confidence="99">

**Transaction ID**: `96354c602231b48fdc0282052cd386a1950a0ef672799c00778e0a042595a303`

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Block Height** | 905,378 |
| **Block Timestamp** | 2025-07-13 14:35:01 UTC |
| **Status** | Confirmed (immutable) |

**Transaction Structure**:

```
INPUT:
  bc1qucpas3u8xtem77cyj8dghr9apa4v2h6ht2d4c2    2,165 sats

OUTPUT 0:
  1CFBdvaiZgZPTZERqnezAtDQJuGHKoHSzg             548 sats

OUTPUT 1 (OP_RETURN):
  "NOTICE TO OWNER - See https://salomonbros.com/owner-notice"

OUTPUT 2 (change):
  bc1qucpas3u8xtem77cyj8dghr9apa4v2h6ht2d4c2    512 sats
```

**Mathematical note on 548 sats**: 548 = **137 × 4**. The fine structure constant α ≈ 1/137 appears throughout physics and cryptography. Whether this is intentional encoding is Tier 3 — the number itself is on-chain fact.

**Verification**:
```bash
curl https://blockstream.info/api/tx/96354c602231b48fdc0282052cd386a1950a0ef672799c00778e0a042595a303
```
</Evidence>

### 1.2 1CFB Has Never Responded

<Evidence tier="1" confidence="99">

The address `1CFBdvaiZgZPTZERqnezAtDQJuGHKoHSzg` (created January 13, 2009):

```json
{
  "chain_stats": {
    "funded_txo_count": 2,
    "funded_txo_sum": 549,
    "spent_txo_count": 0,
    "spent_txo_sum": 0,
    "tx_count": 2
  }
}
```

**Interpretation of on-chain data**:
- Received 2 outputs (the original 1 sat + the 548 sat notice) = 549 sats total
- **0 outgoing transactions** — never spent a single satoshi since creation in 2009
- The address has not moved in **16+ years**

The Salomon Brothers notice set a deadline (documented on salomonbros.com). That deadline has passed. **1CFB did not respond.**

**Verification**:
```bash
curl https://blockstream.info/api/address/1CFBdvaiZgZPTZERqnezAtDQJuGHKoHSzg
```
</Evidence>

## Section 2: The Salomon Brothers Wallet Infrastructure

### 2.1 Complete Wallet Chain (Fully Traceable)

<Evidence tier="1" confidence="99">

The sender's wallet traces back to a master coordination wallet through a clean three-layer structure:

```
LAYER 1 — Master Coordination Wallet:
  bc1q2f60twvuwftp50dz4hmjphyw9ntwaeyhpqul99
  69 transactions | 1.89 BTC total throughput

LAYER 2 — Intermediary:
  bc1ql7vwnz07nhlh42nv8qmy79ds5jlw84e0ls964c
  5 transactions | 1,490,592 sats throughput

LAYER 3 — Sender (direct notice sender):
  bc1qucpas3u8xtem77cyj8dghr9apa4v2h6ht2d4c2
  ├── Block 905,369 (13:30 UTC): NOTICE → 17ChJM9H9oQFYHPyrWo7FicQ2LPgQuQ1qD
  ├── Block 905,371 (13:53 UTC): NOTICE → 1ApkoBW78TXdadKxS92HTJ8HZdNX4LEXNM
  └── Block 905,378 (14:35 UTC): NOTICE → 1CFBdvaiZgZPTZERqnezAtDQJuGHKoHSzg
  └── Block 905,394: SWEEP BACK → Master (1,006 inputs consolidated!)
```

The sweep-back transaction in block 905,394 consolidating 1,006 inputs into the master wallet confirms this was a **professional, automated campaign infrastructure** — not a one-off message.
</Evidence>

### 2.2 Scale of the Campaign

<Evidence tier="2" confidence="85">

According to Salomon Brothers' own documentation and independent research (Galaxy Research report):

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total OP_RETURN notices sent** | 41,523 |
| **Unique addresses targeted** | 39,423 |
| **Estimated BTC in targeted wallets** | ~2.3M BTC |
| **Campaign period** | Summer 2025 |

**Galaxy Research conclusion**: The legal doctrine of "constructive notice" applied here is historically valid but currently **unenforceable without the private keys**. No court can compel transfer of Bitcoin without proof of control of the private keys.

The campaign appears designed to document awareness attempts by potential heirs, business partners, or legal successors of the original key holders.
</Evidence>

## Section 3: The Three Targeted Addresses — What They Have in Common

### 3.1 The Simultaneous Targeting on July 13, 2025

<Evidence tier="1" confidence="99">

Three addresses received notices within **65 minutes** of each other on July 13, 2025:

| Time (UTC) | Address | Block | Current Status |
|-----------|---------|-------|---------------|
| 13:30 | `17ChJM9H9oQFYHPyrWo7FicQ2LPgQuQ1qD` | 905,369 | Active — 234 BTC held |
| 13:53 | `1ApkoBW78TXdadKxS92HTJ8HZdNX4LEXNM` | 905,371 | Unknown |
| 14:35 | `1CFBdvaiZgZPTZERqnezAtDQJuGHKoHSzg` | 905,378 | Dormant — 549 sats |

These three were likely in the same "batch" of the campaign infrastructure.

**Why this batch matters**: These are not random addresses. `1CFB` was one of the earliest Bitcoin vanity addresses (January 13, 2009) and has mathematical significance documented in this research. Its inclusion in the same 65-minute batch as `17ChJM` (a 234 BTC whale) and `1ApkoBW` (received 106.37 BTC in 2012) suggests targeted selection, not random inclusion.
</Evidence>

### 3.2 The 1ApkoBW Connection — 2012 Origin

<Evidence tier="2" confidence="80">

The address `1ApkoBW78TXdadKxS92HTJ8HZdNX4LEXNM` has an interesting provenance:

**Source transaction** (Block 179,360, May 9, 2012):
```
TXID: 947109360afecac2f3eff2cfd8be29f52c43eee65b970c26ef6d3326cb9197f0

Input:  18dkp934Bu68MhasxA8UB2gEtRZJtScvdi  (292 BTC)
Output: 13CgqWHoTbS2gch3GjtG7kwLLQmt4finrB  (185.63 BTC)
Output: 1ApkoBW78TXdadKxS92HTJ8HZdNX4LEXNM  (106.37 BTC)
Fee:    0 BTC
```

A single source address (`18dkp934`) split 292 BTC into two outputs in 2012, one of which is `1ApkoBW`. The source address `18dkp934` is consistent with early OG Bitcoin wallet management patterns.

**Status**: The `1ApkoBW` address received 106.37 BTC in 2012. Whether it was ever spent requires further on-chain verification. The Salomon Brothers targeting of this address in the same batch as 1CFB suggests they considered it a dormant OG holding.
</Evidence>

### 3.3 The 17ChJM Anomaly

<Evidence tier="2" confidence="75">

`17ChJM9H9oQFYHPyrWo7FicQ2LPgQuQ1qD` is the most unusual of the three targeted addresses:

- Received a total of **3,262 BTC** across its history
- Currently holds **~234 BTC** (unspent)
- Has **exactly 676 transactions** — a number that equals 26² = Qubic's Computor count
- Hash160 first byte = **0x44 = 68 = 4 × 17** (17 = position of 'Q' in the alphabet = self-referential encoding)
- byte sum mod 19 = **17 = Q** (encodes the letter Q in the modular arithmetic system)

This address uses a different mathematical encoding than the 1CFB/1CFi system (byte sum 2449 vs. 2299) but is clearly constructed by someone familiar with Qubic numerology.

**Open question**: Was this address deliberately included in the Salomon Brothers batch because of its connection to the Qubic ecosystem, or was it targeted purely as a BTC whale?

See [104: Address Archaeology](/docs/en/03-results/104-address-archaeology) for full mathematical analysis.

## Section 4: Legal Assessment

### 4.1 What This Campaign Can and Cannot Achieve

<Evidence tier="2" confidence="90">

**What the campaign proved (legally)**:
- The current keyholder of `1CFB` was given constructive notice of a claim
- The notice is permanently recorded on-chain — cannot be erased
- Silence past the deadline creates a legal record of non-response

**What the campaign cannot achieve**:
- Bitcoin private keys cannot be transferred by court order
- No judge can compel a keyholder who remains anonymous
- "Constructive notice" only has effect if a legal proceeding follows in a jurisdiction with standing
- The campaign is legally unenforceable without the private keys

**Galaxy Research conclusion** (confirmed independently): The constructive notice doctrine has historical precedent in property law but has never been tested for Bitcoin in court. The campaign appears to be establishing a legal paper trail rather than expecting immediate compliance.
</Evidence>

---

## Section 5: The Broader Context

### 5.1 Why Target 1CFB Specifically?

The address `1CFBdvaiZgZPTZERqnezAtDQJuGHKoHSzg` was created 4 days after the Bitcoin Genesis Block (January 13, 2009). It was the **first Bitcoin address** to use the letter sequence "CFB" as a vanity prefix — at a time when generating such addresses required significant computational effort.

The inclusion of 1CFB in the Salomon Brothers campaign raises a question the campaign itself cannot answer: **Was 1CFB targeted because the Salomon Brothers entity knows who controls it, or because it is simply a notable dormant address?**

The on-chain evidence is silent on this. What the evidence does confirm:
1. 1CFB was targeted on July 13, 2025
2. 1CFB never responded
3. The deadline passed

### 5.2 The 80K BTC Misconception

<Callout type="warning" title="What This Campaign Is NOT">
The Salomon Brothers campaign has been **incorrectly linked** in various research to a specific "80,000 BTC MyBitcoin" incident.

**The 80,000 BTC** referenced in MyBitcoin/Tom Williams research **moved on July 4, 2025** — **9 days BEFORE** the Salomon Brothers notices (July 13, 2025). There is **no direct on-chain connection** between the 80K BTC movement and the Salomon Brothers notice campaign.

The campaign targeted **~2.3M BTC across 39,423 addresses** — it is not specifically about 80K BTC.
</Callout>
