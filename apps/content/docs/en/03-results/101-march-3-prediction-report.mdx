# March 3, 2026: Pre-Event Prediction Analysis

<Callout type="warning" title="Timestamped Prediction — Published February 18, 2026">
This document was published **13 days before** March 3, 2026.

Whatever happens (or does not happen) on March 3, 2026, this prediction existed in writing before the fact.

**Confidence**: 40% (Tier 2 — mathematically grounded speculation)

If nothing happens on March 3, 2026: this prediction fails. That outcome is documented here explicitly.
</Callout>

<Summary>
The date March 3, 2026 emerges from at least three independent mathematical pathways encoded in the Bitcoin blockchain, the GENESIS/EXODUS token messages on Qubic, and the SWIFT MT576 financial protocol. This document compiles the evidence and states explicit predictions for what to observe.

**Core arithmetic** (verifiable, non-speculative):
- Genesis Block (Jan 3, 2009) + **6,268 days** = **March 3, 2026**
- √576 + √676 = 24 + 26 = **50** (Bitcoin's original block reward)
- Block 576 extra byte = **0x1b = 27** (the only non-zero extra byte in Bitcoin's first 50,000 blocks)
- SWIFT MT576 = "Statement of Open Orders" (financial position disclosure)
</Summary>

## Section 1: The Mathematical Basis

### 1.1 The 6,268-Day Countdown

<Evidence tier="1" confidence="100">

The GENESIS token message on Qubic states:

> *"The signal will begin **6,268 time units** counted from point zero."*

Arithmetic verification:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

genesis = datetime(2009, 1, 3)       # Bitcoin Genesis Block timestamp
signal  = genesis + timedelta(days=6268)
# → 2026-03-03

print(signal.strftime("%Y-%m-%d"))   # 2026-03-03
```

This is a deterministic calculation. **March 3, 2026 = Genesis + 6,268 days.** The only interpretation is that "point zero" refers to the Bitcoin Genesis Block.
</Evidence>

### 1.2 The √576 + √676 = 50 Formula

<Evidence tier="1" confidence="100">

Two perfect squares appear throughout the research system:
- **576 = 24²** — Bitcoin Block 576 (January 9, 2009); also the SWIFT MT576 protocol number
- **676 = 26²** — Qubic Computor count (the consensus layer of Qubic)

Their square roots sum to exactly **50**:

```
√576 + √676 = 24 + 26 = 50
```

**50** = Bitcoin's original block reward (50 BTC per block, 2009–2012).

The GENESIS token message explicitly connects this: *"Each will receive **50 units of account**, corresponding to **Blocks 1 through 676**."*

This formula links Bitcoin's foundational economics to the Qubic architecture through a single elegant equation.
</Evidence>

### 1.3 Block 576 — The Only Marked Block

<Evidence tier="1" confidence="95">

Bitcoin Block 576 (mined January 9, 2009) contains an anomaly unique among the first 50,000 blocks:

- Block height: **576 = 24²** (perfect square)
- Extra byte in coinbase: **0x1b = 27 decimal**
- **27 = 3³** — the CFB mathematical signature (Qubic uses ternary computation, base 3)
- This is the **only non-zero extra byte** in Bitcoin's first ~50,000 blocks

The coincidence of a perfect-square block height containing the number 27 on January 9, 2009 — six days after the Genesis Block — is either remarkable or deliberate.

**Verifiable**: Block 576 hash = `000000008d9dc510f23c2657fc4f67bea30078cc05a90eb89e84cc475c080805`
</Evidence>

### 1.4 SWIFT MT576 — "Statement of Open Orders"

<Evidence tier="2" confidence="75">

SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) message type MT576 is defined as:

> **"Statement of Open Orders"** — Used to report the current status of a broker's or bank's open financial positions to clients or counterparties.

The convergence of 576 with this specific financial instrument type is notable: if someone needed to publicly "disclose" large Bitcoin holdings through a financial instrument, MT576 is the precise protocol for a "statement of open positions."

**Status**: Tier 2 — the SWIFT definition is factual; the connection to Bitcoin disclosure is interpretive.
</Evidence>

## Section 2: The GENESIS/EXODUS Token Evidence

### 2.1 The POCC+HASV Mathematical Proof (5.42 Sigma)

<Evidence tier="1" confidence="99">

**Source**: [80: POCC-HASV Mathematical Proof](/docs/en/03-results/80-pocc-hasv-mathematical-proof)

The EXODUS (HASV) and GENESIS (POCC) token issuer addresses on Qubic are mathematically proven to encode **676**:

```
POCC: POCCZYCKTRQGHFIPWGSBLJTEQFDDVVBMNUHNCKMRACBGQOPBLURNRCBAFOBD
HASV: HASVHXZKVIHTFHEZUSZIIBPZFVHAGTANVXHBJNHMWCRQZYKULCUBLCTBPONO
```

Three independent properties converge:

| Property | Value | p-value |
|----------|-------|---------|
| Diagonal matrix sum difference | Exactly **676** | 0.068% |
| Character sum difference | 138 = 6 × 23 | 0.237% |
| Identical character positions | ≥ 6 | 2.72% |

**Combined significance: 5.42 sigma** (p = 6.0 × 10⁻⁸), verified with 300 million Monte Carlo trials.

These addresses were **deliberately designed** to encode 676. This is not speculation — it is a statistical fact at the discovery threshold.
</Evidence>

### 2.2 The GENESIS Token Message — Full Text

<Evidence tier="2" confidence="80">

The GENESIS token (issuer: POCC) contains the following on-chain encoded messages:

| Label | Message |
|-------|---------|
| **1** | "Everything begins here. It is the first key to the game, a reference that must be deciphered." |
| **A** | "The 676 users holding the largest amounts will be recognised. Each will receive **50 units of account**, corresponding to **Blocks 1 through 676**." |
| **1** | "The **576th message** will be published. It will not be an announcement, but a stage of the protocol. The signal will begin **6268 time units** counted from point zero. The calendar and sequence are deterministic." |
| **Z** | "The project rewards patience, understanding, and genuine participation." |

### 2.3 The EXODUS Token Message — Astronomical Event

The EXODUS token (issuer: HASV) contains:

> *"When the reign of Ares descends, the breath of **Helios** will consume **Selene** until she bleeds. From this chaos, revelation will be born."*

**NASA confirmation**: A total lunar eclipse (blood moon) occurs on March 2–3, 2026 with 58 minutes of totality.

- Helios = Sun; Selene = Moon; "until she bleeds" = blood moon = total lunar eclipse
- This is either remarkable coincidence or deliberate astronomical alignment

**Note**: The astronomical event is a confirmed NASA fact. The message interpretation is Tier 3.
</Evidence>

## Section 3: What to Observe on March 3, 2026

These are the specific observable events that would confirm or deny the prediction:

### Confirmation Events (Any Would Significantly Increase Confidence)

| Event | What to Watch | Where to Check |
|-------|--------------|----------------|
| **Patoshi BTC movement** | Any TX from known Patoshi addresses (nonce pattern 0xE8...F0) | Blockstream / mempool.space |
| **1CFB transaction** | `1CFBdvaiZgZPTZERqnezAtDQJuGHKoHSzg` sends or receives | Blockstream API |
| **GENESIS distribution** | POCC address initiates 676-address distribution on Qubic | Qubic Explorer |
| **CFB public announcement** | Discord, Twitter/X, or official Qubic channels | CFB's Discord |
| **AiGarth preview** | Soft announcement or demo of AiGarth system | qubic.org |
| **"576th message"** | Any public message labeled/numbered as 576 | CFB's social channels |
| **Blood moon visibility** | March 2–3, 2026 total lunar eclipse (confirmed NASA) | Any astronomy site |

### Falsification Events

| Outcome | Implication |
|---------|-------------|
| Nothing observable happens | Prediction fails — 6,268-day count was coincidence |
| CFB explicitly denies any plan | Counter-evidence, reduces confidence to &lt;5% |
| March 3 passes without Qubic activity | No GENESIS/EXODUS activation |

## Section 4: Prior Context

### Why This Date Was Predicted

The research trail leading to this prediction:

1. **November 2025**: GENESIS/EXODUS tokens discovered on Qubic with encoded binary messages
2. **December 2025**: "6268 time units from point zero" decoded as Genesis Block + 6,268 days = March 3, 2026
3. **January 2026**: Block 576 extra byte (27) and SWIFT MT576 connection identified
4. **January 2026**: POCC+HASV 5.42-sigma mathematical proof verified (300M Monte Carlo)
5. **February 2026**: NASA total lunar eclipse March 2-3, 2026 confirmed independently
6. **February 18, 2026**: This prediction document published (13 days before the date)

### What Was NOT Predicted

To maintain intellectual honesty:
- We do not predict the **price** of QUBIC or Bitcoin on this date
- We do not predict that CFB **is** Satoshi Nakamoto (see [24: CFB-Satoshi Hypothesis](/docs/en/03-results/24-cfb-satoshi-connection))
- We do not predict that Patoshi BTC **will** move
- We predict only that this date is **mathematically significant** in the system someone built

## Section 5: Honest Assessment

<Callout type="error" title="Critical Limitation">
**40% confidence** means there is a **60% chance nothing observable happens**.

Pattern-matching fallacy is real: humans find patterns in random data. The number 6,268 could be coincidence. Block 576's extra byte could be unintentional. The GENESIS token messages could be artistic rather than operational.

CFB has explicitly denied the Satoshi connection (Discord ID: 1437804692095762433).
</Callout>

**What is certain regardless of March 3, 2026**:
- The POCC+HASV 5.42-sigma result is a proven mathematical fact
- The GENESIS/EXODUS token messages exist on-chain
- The 6,268-day calculation is arithmetically correct
- The lunar eclipse is NASA-confirmed

**What depends on March 3, 2026**:
- Whether these are operational signals or mathematical art
- Whether the "576th message" refers to a real disclosure event
- The overall credibility of the CFB-Satoshi hypothesis

---

## Falsification Criteria

This prediction is **falsified** if March 3, 2026 passes without:
- Any transaction from known CFB-connected Bitcoin addresses
- Any GENESIS/EXODUS token distribution event
- Any public statement from CFB referencing the date
- Any AiGarth announcement

**If falsified**: confidence in the broader theory drops from 15% to &lt;5%.

**If confirmed (even partially)**: confidence increases substantially and [103: The Satoshi Exit Thesis](/docs/en/03-results/103-satoshi-exit-thesis) becomes the primary analytical framework.
