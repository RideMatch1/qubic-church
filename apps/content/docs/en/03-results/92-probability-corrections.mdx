# Probability Corrections: Complete Audit

<Callout type="warning" title="CRITICAL: Most Claimed P-values Are Wrong">
This document corrects every probability claim in the Bitcoin-Qubic Bridge documentation. Most original claims either omit multiple-testing corrections, assume independence when conditions are correlated, or are outright fabricated.
</Callout>

<Summary>
**Purpose**: Correct all probability claims with honest statistics
**Method**: Bonferroni correction, sensitivity analysis, independence testing
**Result**: Only POCC+HASV (p = 2.05e-8) survives correction
</Summary>

## Correction 1: "P less than 10^-500"

**Source**: `anna-collision-analysis.json` metadata

**Original claim**: The probability that the collision distribution is random is less than 10^-500.

**Why it's wrong**: 10^-500 is a physically meaningless number. There are approximately 10^80 atoms in the observable universe. A probability of 10^-500 implies an event less likely than randomly selecting the same atom from the universe 6 times consecutively. No 897-sample dataset can generate such a p-value.

**Honest calculation**:
- Chi-square statistic (minimum): 1,264
- Degrees of freedom: 255
- Z-score (normal approximation): 27.7
- Honest p-value: **p less than 0.001** (highly significant)
- But the non-uniformity is **expected** because the matrix itself has non-uniform value distribution

**Correction factor**: greater than 10^497

**Revised status**: The distribution IS non-uniform, but this reflects the matrix's inherent value bias (dominant values -27, 26, 101, -102), not evidence of a hidden message.

## Correction 2: Timestamp mod 121 = 43

**Source**: Bridge document, Tier 1 evidence

**Original claim**: p = 0.00826 (1/121)

**Problem**: Divisor 121 was selected because it produces remainder 43. This is post-hoc selection. If you test divisors 2 through 200:

| Divisors tested | Correction | Corrected p |
|----------------|------------|-------------|
| 1 (pre-selected) | None | 0.00826 |
| 199 (2-200) | Bonferroni | 1.0 |
| 3 (divisors giving 43) | Bonferroni | 0.025 |

**Additional context**: 21 divisors in [2,200] produce "interesting" remainders. Three divisors (55, 121, 191) produce remainder 43. The selection of 121 = 11^2 and its connection to Qubic (11 quorum members) is narrative-driven.

**Revised status**: **NOT SIGNIFICANT** after correction for post-hoc divisor selection.

---

## Correction 3: Block Mapping Sum = 177

**Source**: Bridge document, 27-divisible block mapping

**Original claim**: p less than 0.001

**Honest calculation**:
- P(sum = 177 with random blocks divisible by 27): 0.0019
- P(sum = 177 with 4 random matrix cells): 0.0016
- Bonferroni correction (11 divisors tested): p = 0.021

**Control result**: 4 out of 11 tested divisors produce "notable" hex byte sums. Divisor 37 produces sum corresponding to ASCII "C", divisor 43 produces "4", divisor 53 produces "L".

**Revised status**: **MARGINAL** (p = 0.021). Not impressive given that multiple divisors produce "notable" results.

---

## Correction 4: 15 "1CFB" Prefix Addresses

**Source**: Bridge document, address derivation

**Original claim**: 15 out of 983,040 addresses start with "1CFB" -- significantly more than expected.

**Honest calculation**:
- Expected under uniform Base58: 983,040 / 58^3 = 5.04
- Observed: 15 (3.0x expected)
- Poisson p(X >= 15 | lambda = 5.04) = 0.000245

**Bonferroni correction**: There are 195,112 possible 4-character prefixes (58^3). We could have been equally excited about ANY prefix appearing 3x expected.

- Corrected p = 0.000245 x 195,112 = **1.0 (NOT SIGNIFICANT)**

**This is a textbook look-elsewhere effect.** In a dataset of 983,040 addresses, some prefix will inevitably appear 3x its expected rate.

**Revised status**: **NOT SIGNIFICANT** after Bonferroni correction.

---

## Correction 5: Block 576 Combined Conditions

**Source**: Bridge document, Block 576 analysis

**Original claim**: P(all conditions coincide) = 7.8 x 10^-6

**Problems**:

1. **576 is NOT divisible by 27** (576 mod 27 = 9). The "27-divisible block" criterion doesn't even apply to Block 576.

2. **Conditions are not independent**:
   - 576 = 24^2 (perfect square) and 576 = 2^6 x 3^2 (factorization) describe the same number
   - These are properties of a CHOSEN number, not random events
   - P(576 has these properties) = 1 (it's a fixed number)

3. **Cherry-picking**: The number 576 was chosen because it has interesting properties, then those properties were presented as if independently discovered.

**Revised status**: **INVALID** -- the probability calculation assumes independence where none exists.

---

## Correction 6: Bayesian 99.6% Posterior

**Source**: Bridge document, combined evidence

**Original claim**: P(Deliberate Design | All Evidence) = 99.6%

**Sensitivity analysis**: The posterior depends entirely on the prior P(Design) and the chosen P(Evidence | Random):

| Prior | With POCC+HASV only (p=2e-8) | With weakened evidence (p=0.01) |
|-------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|
| 0.001 | 99.99% | 5-9% |
| 0.01 | 99.99% | 34-50% |
| 0.05 | 99.99% | 73-84% |
| 0.10 | 100.0% | 85-92% |

**Key insight**: If you use only the POCC+HASV evidence (the one genuinely significant finding), the posterior is high regardless of prior. But the 99.6% claim uses ALL evidence including the non-significant and unverified claims.

**Revised status**: **MISLEADING** -- range is 2% to 99.9% depending on assumptions. The high end requires accepting fabricated evidence.

## Correction 7: March 3, 2026 "Convergences"

**Source**: Bridge document, time-lock prediction

**Original claim**: 6 independent convergences point to March 3, 2026

**Problems**:

1. **Only 3 independent pieces of information** (not 6):
   - Number 576 (gives 24^2 and MT576 for free)
   - Number 121 = 11^2 (gives timestamp mod for free)
   - Epoch 43

2. **The prediction date has not yet been reached** (March 3, 2026 is 25 days away as of Feb 6, 2026).

**Revised status**: **PENDING** -- awaiting March 3, 2026. Regardless of outcome, the claimed "6 independent convergences" are actually only 3 independent pieces of information.

---

## Correction 8: Value -113 Three-Way Collision

**Source**: Bridge hypothesis document

**Original claim**: All 3 derivation methods produce collision value -113, implying deliberate design.

**Honest calculation**:
- P(3 cells all = -113) = (147/16384)^3 = 1 in 1,384,547
- P(3 cells match ANY value) = 1 in 8,837
- 246 out of 256 values would produce equally "impressive" 3-way collisions

**Revised status**: **Look-elsewhere effect**. Not special when considering all possible collision values.

---

## Summary Table

| Claim | Original p | Corrected p | Factor | Status |
|-------|-----------|-------------|--------|--------|
| Collision distribution | less than 10^-500 | less than 0.001 | greater than 10^497 | FABRICATED |
| Timestamp mod 121 | 0.00826 | 1.0 | 121x | NOT SIGNIFICANT |
| Block sum = 177 | less than 0.001 | 0.021 | 11x | MARGINAL |
| 1CFB prefix | 0.000245 | 1.0 | 195,112x | NOT SIGNIFICANT |
| POCC+HASV | 2.05e-8 | 2.05e-8 | 1x | **SIGNIFICANT** |
| Block 576 conditions | 7.8e-6 | N/A | N/A | INVALID |
| Bayesian posterior | 99.6% | 2-99.9% | varies | MISLEADING |
| March 3 prediction | 6 convergences | 3 independent | N/A | PENDING |
| -113 collision | 1 in 1.4M | 1 in 8,837 | 157x | LOOK-ELSEWHERE |

## Methodology Notes

1. **Bonferroni correction**: Applied whenever multiple comparisons are made. This is conservative (reduces false positives at the cost of false negatives), which is appropriate for extraordinary claims.

2. **Pre-registered hypotheses**: All hypotheses were stated before running tests, preventing post-hoc hypothesis selection.

3. **Control experiments**: Every claim was compared against a random baseline or alternative parameter set.

4. **Monte Carlo simulation**: 10,000+ simulations used for empirical p-value estimation where analytical solutions are unavailable.

5. **Independence testing**: All combined probability claims were checked for condition independence.
