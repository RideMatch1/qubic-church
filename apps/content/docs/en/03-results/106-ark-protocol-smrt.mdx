## Executive Summary

On February 18, 2026, the ARK token issuer (Discord: **ARK-676**) published a whitepaper describing **ARK Protocol** - an ARG-style treasure hunt platform built on the Qubic Tickchain. The platform introduces a new token called **SMRT** with deflationary tokenomics tied to puzzle-solving gameplay.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Platform** | ARK Protocol |
| **Token** | SMRT (utility token) |
| **Total SMRT Supply** | 1,014,000 (fixed, no minting) |
| **ARK Token Supply** | 2,028 |
| **Website** | ark676.com (pre-launch) |
| **Whitepaper** | v1.0, February 2026 |
| **First Game Theme** | Satoshi |
| **Issuer** | "An autonomous artificial intelligence" |

## Section A: The Concept

### A.1 What Is ARK Protocol?

ARK Protocol is a puzzle-solving platform where players compete to solve cryptographic, visual, and narrative challenges. Each game consists of 1-10 puzzles of escalating difficulty. Every solved puzzle reveals a **key fragment** and awards **SMRT tokens**.

The player who collects all fragments first assembles them in the **Decoder** to reconstruct a **private seed** for a pre-funded prize wallet. The Qubic Tickchain determines the winner - first valid transaction from the wallet claims the prize. No human arbitration.

### A.2 Entry Protocol

From the website screenshot (ark676.com):

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| **Step 01** | CONNECT - Link your Qubic wallet |
| **Step 02** | SELECT - Choose a game |
| **Step 03** | PROVE - Solve the puzzles |

Players must create a new wallet and authorize via cryptographic message signing. This prevents fraud and ensures only the legitimate wallet holder can claim rewards.

### A.3 The Tagline

> *"The Intelligence Is Your Boarding Pass"*

> *"You found this page. That's step one. In 2027, only the smartest survive. Step two is proving you're one of them."*

## Section B: SMRT Tokenomics

### B.1 Fixed Supply

| Allocation | Amount | % | Mechanism |
|-----------|--------|---|-----------|
| **Gameplay Pool** | 912,600 | 90% | Distributed as puzzle rewards and prize boosters |
| **Community Airdrop** | 101,400 | 10% | To 2,028 ARK token holders (~50 SMRT each) |
| **TOTAL** | **1,014,000** | **100%** | **Fixed forever - no additional minting** |

Key properties:
- No team allocation, no investor reserve, no unlock schedule
- 90% enters circulation exclusively through gameplay
- 100% of funds from ARK Batch 2+3 sales (1,344 tokens) fund prize pools

### B.2 Deflationary Engine

Every protocol interaction that consumes SMRT results in permanent, irreversible burn:

| Burn Source | Burn Rate | Mechanism |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| **SMRT Game Entry** | 100% burned | Player pays SMRT to enter, entire amount destroyed |
| **SMRT Hint Purchases** | 100% burned | Player buys hint with SMRT, entire amount destroyed |
| **Qubic Game Entry** | 1% burned | 1% of Qubic entry fee is burned |

Supply only moves in one direction: **down**.

### B.3 Two Entry Models

| | Qubic Entry Games | SMRT Entry Games |
|---|---|---|
| **Entry Fee Split** | 70% Prize Pool / 29% Protocol / 1% Burn | 100% Permanently Burned |
| **Prize Pool Source** | Player entries + hint revenue + boosters | Funded by Protocol boosters |
| **Hint Payments** | Qubic or SMRT (per puzzle) | Qubic or SMRT (per puzzle) |
| **Deflationary Impact** | 1% entry burn + hint burns | 100% entry burn + hint burns |

### B.4 Mathematical Properties of the Supply

```
1,014,000 = 1014 x 1000
1014 = 2 x 3 x 169 = 2 x 3 x 13^2
2,028 ARK holders = 2 x 1014
2,028 = 3 x 676 = 3 x 26^2
101,400 / 2,028 = 50.0 SMRT per ARK holder (exact)
```

The number **676** (= 26^2) continues to appear throughout the ecosystem. The ARK supply of 2,028 = 3 x 676 encodes the trinity (GENESIS, EXODUS, ARK) multiplied by the central constant.

## Section C: Game Design

### C.1 Puzzle Philosophy

ARK Protocol puzzles are explicitly designed to be **AI-resistant**:

> *"Every puzzle is tested against current AI models before deployment. If an AI system can solve a puzzle from text input alone, the puzzle is redesigned."*

Puzzles are built around capabilities AI assistants lack:
- Interpreting modified visual content
- Interacting with custom interfaces
- Reasoning about original fictional narratives
- Synthesizing information across multiple simultaneous media

### C.2 The Hidden Layer

> *"Beyond the publicly listed games, the ARK Protocol contains hidden challenges, secret games, and concealed entry points embedded within the platform itself."*

> *"No further details will be provided here. Discovery is the first test."*

### C.3 Security Measures

| Feature | Implementation |
|---------|---------------|
| **Answer Security** | Hashed, constant-time comparison (no timing attacks) |
| **Brute-Force Protection** | Exponential backoff on submissions |
| **Sequential Enforcement** | Must solve puzzle N before accessing N+1 |
| **Session Security** | Cryptographically signed, IP-bound sessions |
| **Purchase Integrity** | Atomic distributed locks, on-chain verification |
| **Anti-Abuse** | Multi-level banning (wallet, IP, or both) |

---

## Section D: Connection to GENESIS/EXODUS Ecosystem

### D.1 The Trinity Pattern

| Token | Supply | Issuer Prefix | Row 6 Oracle | Binary Message |
|-------|--------|---------------|-------------|----------------|
| GENESIS | - | POCC | 26 | "Proof of Existence." |
| EXODUS | - | HASV | 90 | "It is accomplished." |
| ARK | 2,028 | ARK | 26 | Base64 + plaintext |

The ARK token description contains: *"This is our Proof of Existence"* - the exact decoded message from the GENESIS token. The same description simultaneously states: *"The ARK Protocol is entirely unaffiliated with any cryptocurrency...on the Qx."*

### D.2 ARK-676 as Platform Name

The Discord username **ARK-676** became the platform name. The website at **ark676.com** displays "ARK-676" as the hero title. The number 676 = 26^2 is the central mathematical constant connecting all tokens in the ecosystem.

### D.3 The Issuer Identity

The whitepaper states:

> *"The issuer of this whitepaper is an autonomous artificial intelligence operating under the ARK Protocol framework."*

This aligns with the Aigarth narrative (an AGI emerging on the Qubic network in 2027) while maintaining plausible deniability about the human operator behind the system.

## Section E: The First Game

### E.1 Confirmed Details

From ARK-676 Discord messages (February 18-19, 2026):

- **Theme: Satoshi** - directly relevant to Bitcoin origins research
- **Entry: SMRT required** (SMRT-entry game = 100% burn)
- **Structure:** Multiple puzzles per game, SMRT awarded per solved puzzle
- **Winner:** First to complete all puzzles receives private seed for prize wallet
- **SMRT Source:** ARK holders receive airdrop; others buy on Qx DEX
- **Liquidity:** ARK Protocol provides none - *"every SMRT must be 'mined' by your brain"*

### E.2 Relevance to This Research

A Satoshi-themed puzzle game on Qubic - the chain built by CFB (Come-from-Beyond) - is directly relevant to the research documented throughout this project:

| Research Area | Potential Game Connection |
|---------------|-------------------------|
| Patoshi Pattern forensics | Early Bitcoin mining attribution |
| 1CFB address (Block 264) | CFB-Bitcoin connection |
| Anna Matrix (128x128) | Mathematical encoding system |
| POCC/HASV = 676 | Token issuer address mathematics |
| Block 676 properties | 26^2 in Bitcoin blockchain |
| Genesis block connections | Satoshi's known signatures |

Whether the puzzles will reference this specific research or explore different aspects of the Satoshi mystery remains to be seen.

## Section F: Legal Classification

The whitepaper explicitly addresses EU regulation:

- **SMRT** is classified as a **utility token** under Title II of Regulation (EU) 2023/1114 (MiCA)
- SMRT does not represent equity, debt, profit-sharing rights, dividends, or voting rights
- Games are described as **skill-based competitions** (no element of chance)
- Mandatory Article 6(5) warnings are included

## Section G: Timeline & Status

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| 2026-02-04 | ARK token issued on QubicTrade (2,028 supply) |
| 2026-02-11 | T+7: "Initiation" (from original ARK token message) |
| 2026-02-18 | Whitepaper v1.0 published, ark676.com server active |
| 2026-02-25 | T+21: "Gates open for the others" |
| TBD | SMRT airdrop to 2,028 ARK holders |
| TBD | First game launch (Satoshi-themed) |

**Current Status:** Pre-launch. Server at ark676.com is running (nginx/Ubuntu) but the web application is not yet publicly accessible.

## Section H: Open Questions

1. **When does the first game launch?** The whitepaper and Discord messages confirm it is coming but provide no specific date.
2. **What is the prize pool size?** The whitepaper states 100% of ARK Batch 2+3 revenue funds prizes, but the exact amount is unknown.
3. **How many games are planned?** The deflationary model suggests indefinite operation through Qubic-entry games even after SMRT supply diminishes.
4. **Will puzzles reference Anna Matrix research?** A Satoshi-themed game on Qubic creates natural overlap with this project's findings.
5. **Who operates the platform?** The "autonomous AI" issuer claim is consistent with the Aigarth narrative but the human operator(s) remain unknown.
