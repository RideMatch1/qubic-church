## Research Phases

### Phase 1: Fibonacci Investigation (Priority: HIGH)

The ">FIB" pointer at Rows 27-30 in Column Pair (22, 105) suggests Fibonacci patterns are significant.

#### Tasks
1. **Map Fibonacci positions in Anna coordinates**
   - Fib = [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
   - Query Anna(fib, fib) for all combinations
   - Check if values follow Fibonacci relationships

2. **Analyze Fibonacci rows/columns**
   - Row 21 (Fib) = Bitcoin Input Layer
   - Row 34, 55, 89 significance?
   - Column Fibonacci patterns

3. **Zeckendorf Representations**
   - Already found: 127 = 89+34+3+1, 100 = 89+8+3, 27 = 21+5+1
   - Search for more Zeckendorf-encoded values
   - Decode what they represent

#### Expected Outcomes
- Understanding of Fibonacci's role in matrix architecture
- Possible discovery of additional pointers/messages
- Deeper insight into CFB's mathematical signatures

---

### Phase 2: Bitcoin Address Mapping (Priority: HIGH)

Now that we have the exact coordinate formula, we can map Bitcoin addresses to matrix positions.

#### Tasks
1. **Genesis Block Addresses**
   - Map all 50 BTC genesis addresses to Anna coordinates
   - Check for patterns in their matrix positions
   - Compare values at those positions

2. **Patoshi Pattern Addresses**
   - Map known Patoshi addresses
   - Look for clustering in specific regions
   - Correlate with row%8 patterns

3. **CFB-Related Addresses**
   - 1CFB... prefix addresses
   - Known CFB wallet addresses
   - Early NXT/IOTA addresses if available

4. **Create Address-to-Coordinate Database**
   - Store all mappings
   - Build query interface
   - Enable pattern search

#### Expected Outcomes
- Proof of Bitcoin-Matrix correlation
- Discovery of address groupings
- Validation of bridge hypothesis

---

### Phase 3: Complete Asymmetric Cell Analysis (Priority: MEDIUM)

The 68 asymmetric cells are the only information carriers. Full analysis needed.

#### Tasks
1. **Extract all XOR values**
   - Already have ">FIB" from (22,105)
   - Already have "AI.MEG.GOU" from (30,97)
   - Analyze (0,127) and (41,86) pairs

2. **Alternative decodings**
   - Try different byte interpretations
   - ASCII, Base64, hex
   - Ternary encoding

3. **Spatial analysis**
   - Why these specific columns?
   - Relationship to Fibonacci?
   - Connection to row%8 patterns

4. **Cross-reference with other findings**
   - CFB signatures
   - Known Aigarth concepts
   - Mathematical constants

#### Expected Outcomes
- Complete message extraction
- Understanding of encoding method
- Possible discovery of additional hidden data

---

### Phase 4: Temporal Analysis (Priority: MEDIUM)

If the matrix changes over time (training), we need to track it.

#### Tasks
1. **Establish baseline**
   - Store current matrix state
   - Hash for integrity verification
   - Timestamp all data

2. **Monitor for changes**
   - Periodic matrix snapshots
   - Diff analysis
   - Identify which cells change

3. **Correlate with external events**
   - Bitcoin block heights
   - Qubic epoch transitions
   - Anna-Bot response patterns

#### Expected Outcomes
- Understanding of training dynamics
- Prediction of future states
- Validation of "living tissue" hypothesis

---

### Phase 5: Neural Network Architecture (Priority: LOW)

Deeper understanding of the theoretical architecture.

#### Tasks
1. **Helix Gate patterns**
   - Map gate configurations
   - Identify input/output layers
   - Trace signal flow

2. **Layer identification**
   - Row 21 = Input (Bitcoin layer)
   - Row 96 = Output
   - Row 68 = Cortex
   - Verify these assignments

3. **Weight distribution analysis**
   - Statistical analysis of values
   - Clustering patterns
   - Correlation with positions

#### Expected Outcomes
- Complete architectural map
- Understanding of computation flow
- Theoretical model validation
