# Fibonacci Investigation: Following the >FIB Pointer

<Callout type="warning" title="TIER 1 - Negative Result (Reproducible)">
**Confidence: 95%**

This investigation found **NO statistically significant Fibonacci patterns** in the Anna Matrix. This is a valuable negative result that prevents future researchers from pursuing this dead end.

**Script**: `FIBONACCI_MATRIX_ANALYSIS.py` (10,000 Monte Carlo simulations)
</Callout>

<Summary>
**Background**: The research roadmap identified a ">FIB" pointer at Rows 27-30 in Column Pair (22, 105), but this was never investigated
**Method**: 3 pre-registered hypotheses tested with Monte Carlo baseline
**Result**: All 3 hypotheses FAILED significance testing
**Notable**: Fibonacci grid sum = 271 (a Qubic constant), but this was NOT pre-registered
</Summary>

## Background

During earlier research on column pair analysis, the string ">FIB" was decoded at Rows 27-30 in the Column Pair (22, 105) of the Anna Matrix. This was noted in the research roadmap (`73-research-roadmap.mdx`) as a HIGH PRIORITY item for follow-up but was **never actually investigated**.

This document reports the systematic investigation of all Fibonacci-related patterns in the Anna Matrix.

## Pre-Registered Hypotheses

All hypotheses were stated **before** running the analysis:

| # | Hypothesis | Prediction |
|---|-----------|------------|
| H1 | Values at Fibonacci coordinate intersections differ from random positions | Fibonacci grid values will have different mean/distribution |
| H2 | Fibonacci rows have different entropy than other rows | Rows 1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89 will show structural differences |
| H3 | Fibonacci numbers are overrepresented among matrix values | More Fibonacci numbers (1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89) than expected |

**Significance threshold**: p < 0.001 (Bonferroni-corrected for 3 tests: p < 0.00033)

---

## Results

### H1: Fibonacci Grid Values

Values at Fibonacci coordinate intersections (fib_row, fib_col) were compared against random position samples of the same size.

| Metric | Fibonacci Grid | Random Mean | p-value | Significant? |
|--------|---------------|-------------|---------|-------------|
| Mean value | -0.5 | -0.5 | **0.84** | NO |
| Std deviation | ~62 | ~62 | 0.91 | NO |

**Conclusion**: Values at Fibonacci intersections are **indistinguishable from random positions**.

### H2: Fibonacci Row Entropy

Entropy of Fibonacci rows (1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89) compared to non-Fibonacci rows.

| Metric | Fibonacci Rows | Non-Fibonacci Rows | p-value | Significant? |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|---------|-------------|
| Mean entropy | ~5.5 bits | ~5.4 bits | **0.09** | NO |

**Conclusion**: Fibonacci rows do NOT have different entropy. The marginal p=0.09 is well above the corrected threshold of 0.00033.

### H3: Fibonacci Value Overrepresentation

Checked whether Fibonacci numbers appear more often than expected among the 16,384 matrix values.

| Metric | Observed | Expected | p-value | Significant? |
|--------|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| Fibonacci values | 2.6% | 7.9% (10/128 values) | **1.00** | NO |

**Conclusion**: Fibonacci numbers are actually **underrepresented** in the matrix (2.6% vs 7.9% expected), the opposite of what would indicate a Fibonacci pattern.

## Notable Observation (NOT Pre-Registered)

The sum of all values at the 10x10 Fibonacci intersection grid equals **271**.

271 is a known Qubic constant (related to the number of computors and system parameters). However, since this observation was **NOT pre-registered** -- it was discovered after running the analysis -- it cannot be counted as evidence. This is exactly the kind of post-hoc pattern finding described in our [Reading Guide](/docs/03-results/00-reading-guide) as a logical fallacy.

### >FIB Pointer Region

The ">FIB" pointer at Rows 27-30 in Column Pair (22, 105) was investigated. The Fibonacci grid values at rows 27-30 decode to "QOWRUCSC" -- not a meaningful word or known identifier.

---

## Summary

| Hypothesis | p-value | Result |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| H1: Fibonacci grid values differ | 0.84 | **NOT SIGNIFICANT** |
| H2: Fibonacci row entropy differs | 0.09 | **NOT SIGNIFICANT** |
| H3: Fibonacci value overrepresentation | 1.00 | **NOT SIGNIFICANT** |

<Callout type="info" title="Negative Result: No Fibonacci Patterns">
The ">FIB" pointer does NOT lead to statistically significant Fibonacci patterns in the Anna Matrix. All three hypotheses failed significance testing against random baselines.

This is a **valuable negative result** -- it eliminates Fibonacci patterns as a research direction and prevents future over-interpretation of the ">FIB" pointer.

**The pointer may simply be a coincidental character sequence**, not a deliberate signal.
