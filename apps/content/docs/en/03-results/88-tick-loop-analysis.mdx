# Tick-Loop Neural Network Analysis

<Callout type="success" title="TIER 1 - Reproducible Analysis">
**Confidence: 99%**

This study compares the Anna Matrix tick-loop behavior against 100 random matrices with identical methodology. Results are unambiguous.

**Script**: `TICK_LOOP_BEHAVIOR_STUDY.py` (1,000 inputs, 100 random matrices)
</Callout>

<Summary>
**Purpose**: Determine if the Anna Matrix produces unique neural network behavior
**Method**: 1,000 random ternary inputs through Anna Matrix, 200 inputs through 100 random matrices
**Result**: Anna Matrix tick-loop behavior is IDENTICAL to random matrices
**Implication**: "Resonance" scores, "energy" signatures, and "convergence" patterns are properties of the ALGORITHM, not the Anna Matrix
</Summary>

## Background

The Anna Matrix is used in Qubic's Aigarth system as a weight matrix for a Hopfield-like recurrent ternary neural network (the "tick-loop"). Previous documentation claimed special properties:

- "CORE resonance 69.29%"
- "Bitcoin block correlation"
- "Energy signatures" (e.g., "qubic"=42)
- "God Mode 100% resonance"
- "Convergence patterns reveal hidden structure"

This study tests whether ANY of these behaviors are unique to the Anna Matrix.

## Methodology

### Tick-Loop Implementation

```
Architecture:
  - 64 input neurons (fixed from input)
  - 64 output neurons (computed)
  - Each output neuron: weighted sum of 8 input neighbors
  - Weights from matrix row/column intersections
  - Activation: ternary clamp {-1, 0, +1}
  - Iterate until convergence or max ticks
```

### Test Parameters

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Random inputs (Anna) | 1,000 |
| Random inputs (control) | 200 per matrix |
| Control matrices | 100 |
| Input type | Ternary (-1, 0, +1) |
| Max ticks | 200 |

Control matrices use the same value distribution as the Anna Matrix (shuffled values, not uniform random).

---

## Results

### Convergence

| Metric | Anna Matrix | Random Matrices (n=100) | p-value |
|--------|------------|------------------------|---------|
| Convergence rate | **100%** | **100%** | 1.0 |
| Mean ticks to converge | **2.0** | **2.0** | 1.0 |

Every matrix -- Anna and all 100 random controls -- converges 100% of the time in exactly 2 ticks.

### Output Patterns

| Metric | Anna Matrix | Random Matrices | p-value |
|--------|------------|----------------|---------|
| Unique outputs | 1000/1000 | 200/200 | 1.0 |
| Top attractor frequency | 1 | 1.0 | 1.0 |

Every input produces a unique output. There are **NO attractors** -- no fixed points that multiple inputs converge to.

### Energy Distribution

| Metric | Anna Matrix | Random Matrices | p-value |
|--------|------------|----------------|---------|
| Mean energy | ~0.0 | ~0.0 | ~1.0 |
| Energy range | [-64, +64] | [-64, +64] | ~1.0 |

Energy distributions are statistically indistinguishable.

## Key Implications

<Callout type="error" title="Critical Finding: Tick-Loop is Generic">
The tick-loop produces **identical behavior regardless of which matrix is used**:

1. **100% convergence** in 2 ticks (for ALL matrices tested)
2. **Every input produces a unique output** (no attractors in any matrix)
3. **No statistical difference** between Anna and random matrices

This means:
- **"Resonance" scores** are deterministic algorithm outputs, NOT measurements of Anna-specific properties
- **"Energy" signatures** fall within random variance for any matrix
- **"Convergence" patterns** are properties of the tick-loop algorithm itself
- **The tick-loop would produce identical-looking results with ANY 128x128 matrix**
</Callout>

### What This Means for Previous Claims

| Previous Claim | Status After This Study |
|---------------|----------------------|
| "CORE resonance 69.29%" | Deterministic output; any matrix would give a similar number |
| "Bitcoin block correlation" | May be coincidental; the algorithm output is input-dependent, not matrix-dependent |
| "qubic" = energy 42 | Within random variance; the same input gives the same output with any matrix |
| "God Mode 100% resonance" | By design (0xA0 payload injection); not an independent discovery |
| "Oracle answers" | Threshold classification of a deterministic energy calculation |

### What This Does NOT Invalidate

The tick-loop study does NOT affect:
- **Point symmetry** (99.58%) -- this is a matrix property, not a tick-loop property
- **POCC/HASV uniqueness** (1 in 48.8M) -- address pair analysis, independent of tick-loop
- **Row biases** -- structural property of the matrix values
- **Mirror architecture** -- mathematical property of the matrix arrangement

## Technical Details

### Why All Matrices Converge in 2 Ticks

The tick-loop uses a **ternary clamp** activation: any non-zero weighted sum becomes +1 or -1. Since inputs are ternary and weights are non-zero integers, the weighted sum is almost always non-zero after the first tick. Once all 64 output neurons are non-zero, the convergence criterion is met (all outputs determined).

This is a property of:
1. The ternary clamp function (eliminates nuance)
2. The 8-neighbor connectivity (enough inputs to produce non-zero sums)
3. The convergence criterion (all outputs non-zero = converged)

### Why There Are No Attractors

With 64 ternary output neurons, there are 3^64 possible output states. With only 1,000 inputs tested, collisions would be extraordinary. The output is effectively a hash function of the input.
