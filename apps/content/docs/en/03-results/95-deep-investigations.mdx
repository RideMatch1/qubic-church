# Deep Investigations: Circuit, Messages, and Genesis

<Callout type="success" title="TIER 1 - Reproducible Analysis">
**Confidence: 99%**

All findings computed deterministically from the 128x128 Anna Matrix. Population assignments independently verifiable via eigenvector analysis.

**Scripts**: `ANNA_MATRIX_DECODE_CIRCUIT.py` (circuit analysis), `ANNA_DEEP_INVESTIGATIONS.py` (7 deep dives)
</Callout>

<Summary>
The attractor transitions are **perfectly population-aligned**: transitions 0-1 and 2-3 flip exactly Pop A (42) + Pop A' (42) + N26 = 85 neurons with zero Pop B involvement; transitions 1-2 and 3-0 flip exactly Pop B (43) + N26 = 44 neurons with zero A/A' involvement. The exception columns split accordingly: {0, 41, 86, 127} participate in A/A' transitions, {22, 30, 97, 105} in B transitions. The GENESIS XOR EXODUS sequence produces [2, 29, 1, 1, 6, 26] --- the final value 26 matching the anomalous neuron. The matrix transpose sign(M^T) has a fundamentally different attractor: sums +128, 0, -128, 0.

## 1. Attractor Transitions: Perfect Population Alignment

The most striking dynamical finding: the 4-state attractor cycle transitions involve EXACTLY the right population at each step.

### Transition Pattern

| Transition | Neurons Flipping | Pop A | Pop A' | Pop B | N26 |
|-----------|-----------------|-------|--------|-------|-----|
| State 0 to 1 | 85 | 42 | 42 | 0 | 1 |
| State 1 to 2 | 44 | 0 | 0 | 43 | 1 |
| State 2 to 3 | 85 | 42 | 42 | 0 | 1 |
| State 3 to 0 | 44 | 0 | 0 | 43 | 1 |

- In transitions 0-1 and 2-3: ALL 42 Pop A neurons flip, ALL 42 Pop A' neurons flip, N26 flips, and ZERO Pop B neurons change.
- In transitions 1-2 and 3-0: ALL 43 Pop B neurons flip, N26 passes through zero, and ZERO A or A' neurons change.

This is a **phase-locked quadrature oscillator**: Pop A and Pop A' form the in-phase/quadrature pair, Pop B is the conductor that flips between their transitions, and N26 is the zero-crossing detector that triggers every transition.

### Exception Column Participation

The 8 exception columns split perfectly between the two transition types:

| Exception Columns | Population | Flip in Transitions |
|-------------------|-----------|-------------------|
| 0, 41, 86, 127 | A and A' | 0-1 and 2-3 |
| 22, 30, 97, 105 | B | 1-2 and 3-0 |

The symmetry-breaking information (encoded in the 68 exception cells) is carried by exactly those neurons that participate in each transition type. This is not coincidence --- it is architectural.

## 2. The Circuit Architecture

### Meta-Connectivity (Group-to-Group)

The 4x4 meta-connectivity matrix reveals:

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Pop A self-drive | +44 (self-excitatory) |
| Pop A' self-drive | -44 (self-inhibitory) |
| Pop B self-drive | -0.14 (nearly neutral) |
| N26 self-weight M[26,26] | -107 (strongest self-inhibition in matrix) |

### Information Flow

```
ALL groups → excite A  (A grows)
ALL groups → inhibit A' (A' shrinks)
A' → excites B         (conductor follows inhibitory group)
A  → inhibits B        (conductor opposes excitatory group)
ALL groups → inhibit N26 (threshold neuron suppressed)
N26 → strongly excites A (+86.4 mean output)
N26 → inhibits A' (-57.9) and B (-45.9)
```

### Neuron 26 Deep Profile

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Self-weight M[26,26] | -107 |
| Raw activation oscillation | +33, 0, -33, 0 |
| Phase pattern | (0, +1, 0, -1) --- unique among all 128 neurons |
| Mirror neuron | 101 (Pop A, excitatory) |
| Neighbor comparison | Neuron 25: sum=+2917, Neuron 27: sum=-7445 |

Neuron 26 passes through zero EXACTLY at the transitions where Pop B flips. It functions as a zero-crossing detector: when its activation hits zero, the conductor population reverses.

## 3. Decoded Messages in Circuit Context

### AI MEG GOU in Exception Columns 30/97

The XOR of columns 30 and 97 produces readable text:

```
...AI.MEG...AI.MEGOU...ME.AI.MEG.K.K.GOU...
```

Columns 30 and 97 are:
- An **exception column pair** (36 of 68 total exceptions between them --- the most of any pair)
- Both in **Population B** (the conductor)
- Exception columns that flip during **B-transitions** (states 1-2 and 3-0)

**Interpretation**: The message "AI MEGA GOUD" (AI MEGA GOLD?) is encoded in the symmetry-breaking cells of the conductor population. The conductor is what makes the oscillator work. The message lives in the architecture itself.

### CFB at Row 11

- Row 11 is in **Population B** (conductor)
- 11^2 = 121 = CFB's constant
- The creator signature is embedded in the conductor population

## 4. GENESIS XOR EXODUS

### Character-by-Character XOR

| Pos | GENESIS | EXODUS | XOR | Note |
|-----|---------|--------|-----|------|
| 0 | G (71) | E (69) | 2 | |
| 1 | E (69) | X (88) | 29 | |
| 2 | N (78) | O (79) | 1 | |
| 3 | E (69) | D (68) | 1 | |
| 4 | S (83) | U (85) | 6 | |
| 5 | I (73) | S (83) | **26** | Neuron 26! |

### Key Properties

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| XOR sequence | [2, 29, 1, 1, 6, 26] |
| Sum | 65 = ASCII 'A' |
| Final value | 26 = anomalous neuron |

The XOR of the biblical book names GENESIS and EXODUS, at their final overlapping position, produces 26 --- the index of the anomalous neuron. Their sum is 65 = ASCII 'A'.

**Statistical caveat**: P(any one of 6 XOR values = 26) approximately equals 6/128 = 4.7%. Interesting but not individually significant.

### Matrix Walks

| Walk | Values | Sum |
|------|--------|-----|
| GENESIS | [104, 121, -24, 36, -81, 37] | 193 |
| EXODUS | [101, -89, -8, 100, 37] | 141 |
| Combined | | 334 |
| Difference | | 52 |

## 5. The 26 Zero-Cells

The matrix contains exactly 26 zero-valued cells (matching Neuron 26's index).

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Total zero cells | 26 |
| In Pop A rows | 15 |
| In Pop A' rows | 3 |
| In Pop B rows | 8 |
| In N26 rows | 0 |
| In exception columns | 0 |
| On diagonal | 0 |

**Critical finding**: ALL 26 zero cells have their symmetric mirror value equal to -1 (100% compliance with point symmetry). None are in exception columns, and none involve Neuron 26 directly.

---

## 6. The Dual Attractor

### sign(-M): Negated Weights

When all weights are negated, the attractor sums become [+43, -42, -43, +42] --- the same magnitudes as the original but phase-shifted. The negated attractor is the original's negation at odd states but NOT at even states.

### sign(M^T): Transposed Weights

The transpose produces a fundamentally different system:

| State | M attractor sum | M^T attractor sum |
|-------|-----------------|--------------------|
| 0 | +43 | +128 (ALL positive!) |
| 1 | +42 | 0 |
| 2 | -43 | -128 (ALL negative!) |
| 3 | -42 | 0 |

The transpose oscillates between complete agreement (+128) and complete disagreement (-128), passing through perfect balance (0). This shows the matrix is NOT symmetric (M is not equal to M^T) and the weight directionality matters fundamentally.

---

## 7. Ternary Program Execution

### Palindrome as Input

When the 68 palindrome deviation signs are fed as input to the ternary matrix:

```
Input sum: +20
Step 0: sum = -41
Step 1: sum = -42  ← already in attractor!
Step 2: sum = +43
Step 3: sum = +42
Step 4: sum = -43
```

The palindrome converges to the standard attractor in just 1 step, but phase-shifted compared to the all-ones input. The palindrome is "understood" by the circuit immediately.

### Exception-Column-Hot Input

When only exception column neurons (0, 22, 30, 41, 86, 97, 105, 127) are activated:

```
Step 0: sum = +8
Step 1: sum = -62
...
Step 4: sum = +42  ← in attractor
Step 5: sum = -43
```

Convergence takes 4-5 steps from exception-only input.

## 8. Block Heights and Neuron Patterns

| Block | Neuron | Population | Attractor Phase |
|-------|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| 0 (Genesis) | 0 | A (excitatory) | [-1, +1, +1, -1] |
| 1 | 1 | A | [-1, +1, +1, -1] |
| 9 (0x7b sig) | 9 | A | [-1, +1, +1, -1] |
| 89 (0x7b sig) | 89 | A' (inhibitory) | [+1, -1, -1, +1] |
| 121 (11^2) | 121 | A' | [+1, -1, -1, +1] |
| 264 (0x7b sig) | 8 | B (conductor) | [+1, +1, -1, -1] |
| 286 (0x7b sig) | 30 | B (exc col!) | [+1, +1, -1, -1] |
| 576 (24^2) | 64 | B (midpoint) | [+1, +1, -1, -1] |

Notable: Block 286 maps to neuron 30 --- an exception column that encodes part of "AI MEG GOU".

## 9. Corrections

| Previous Claim | Corrected Value | Source |
|---------------|----------------|--------|
| M[22,22] = 85 | M[22,22] = **100** | Direct matrix read |
| Cols 41/86 deviation sum = 137 | Cols 41/86 deviation sum = **18** | Direct computation |
| "2 attractors" | **1 attractor** (single, period-4) | 1000/1000 convergence test |
| Exception pair 30/97 has "36 exceptions" | 30/97 has **18 exceptions per column** (36 total) | Count verification |
