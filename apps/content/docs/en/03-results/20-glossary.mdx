## Philosophical and Historical Terms

### CCRU (Cybernetic Culture Research Unit)

An experimental cultural theory collective active from 1995 to 2003 at the University of Warwick, England. Led by Nick Land and Sadie Plant, the group developed a practice of "theory-fiction" that blended philosophy, cybernetics, and numerical systems.

**Key contributions**: Numogram, Hyperstition, Pandemonium System
**Relevance**: Possible philosophical precursor to the Qubic/Aigarth architecture
**See**: [Background](/docs/01-introduction/02-background), [Conceptual Frameworks](/docs/03-results/19-conceptual-frameworks)

### Helix Gates

Ternary logic gates that are reversible and functionally complete. A Helix Gate rotates its input by the sum of three ternary values. The term appears identically in both the Numogram system (1990s) and the Qubic/Aigarth architecture, a terminological overlap with an estimated independent convergence probability below 0.1%.

### Hyperstition

A CCRU concept describing ideas that function as "self-fulfilling prophecies" -- fictions that make themselves real through belief and implementation. In the context of this research, the concept is relevant to time-locks and embedded breadcrumb trails.

### Numogram

The "Decimal Labyrinth" system developed by the CCRU in the 1990s. It organizes ten digits into five syzygies and operates through feedback loops and time-circuits.

**Structure**: 10 zones, 5 syzygies, 3 time-systems, Helix gates, Pandemonium System
**Qubic connection**: More than ten structural parallels have been identified, with a combined probability of independent convergence estimated at p < 10^-6
**See**: [Conceptual Frameworks](/docs/03-results/19-conceptual-frameworks)

### Pandemonium System

A CCRU concept describing a distributed architecture in which autonomous entities interact through feedback to produce emergent order from apparent chaos.

**Qubic parallel**: Aigarth's evolutionary neural network architecture
**Original definition**: "Both the place of all demons and the system of all feedbacks"

### Syzygies

In the Numogram: paired zones whose values sum to 9 (i.e., 0+9, 1+8, 2+7, 3+6, 4+5). In the Qubic context, an analogous structure appears in the row%8 complementary classes within the Aigarth neural architecture.

### Theory-Fiction

A CCRU genre that blends theoretical philosophy with fictional narrative, treating ideas as operational systems rather than mere descriptions. The Numogram serving as a blueprint for an AGI architecture is a potential example of theory-fiction becoming working implementation.
