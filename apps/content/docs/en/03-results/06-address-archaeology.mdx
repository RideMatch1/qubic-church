<Summary>
This chapter presents a systematic census of Bitcoin addresses sharing the **1CF prefix**, an analysis of their generation mechanisms, and a forensic examination of early blockchain address patterns. Across seven datasets totaling over two million addresses, we identified **1,169 unique 1CF addresses** -- a 46x enrichment over random expectation, indicating deliberate generation. Hash160 byte-sum analysis reveals distinct algorithmic families among early Bitcoin vanity addresses. On-chain transaction patterns, including precisely encoded satoshi amounts and coordinated messaging events, provide further evidence of structured address management in early Bitcoin history.

## 1. Executive Summary

This investigation combines three complementary analyses:

1. **1CF Prefix Census**: A complete enumeration of 1,169 unique Bitcoin addresses sharing the `1CF` prefix, drawn from over two million addresses across seven datasets.
2. **Hash160 Byte-Sum Signatures**: Mathematical analysis of address generation algorithms, revealing distinct families of vanity addresses with shared byte-sum properties.
3. **Blockchain Forensic Analysis**: Examination of on-chain events including the "NOTICE TO OWNER" messages, early block signatures, and transaction amount encoding.

---

## 2. The 1CF Prefix Census

### 2.1 Search Methodology

We searched the following datasets for all Bitcoin addresses beginning with the prefix `1CF`:

| Dataset | Total Addresses | 1CF Found | Percentage |
|---------|----------------|-----------|------------|
| `bitcoin-private-keys.json` | 772 | 771 | 66.0% |
| `matrix-addresses.json` | 983,040 | 754 | 64.5% |
| `matrix_addresses_with_xor.json` | 983,040 | 754 | (duplicates) |
| `bitcoin-derived-addresses.json` | 20,955 | 17 | 1.5% |
| `interesting-addresses.json` | 30 | 15 | 1.3% |
| `patoshi-addresses.json` | 21,953 | 0 | 0.0% |
| `anna-matrix.json` | 1 | 0 | 0.0% |
| **Total (deduplicated)** | **2,009,791** | **1,169 unique** | **0.058%** |

### 2.2 Prefix Probability

The `1CF` prefix in Bitcoin addresses is produced when the Hash160 (RIPEMD-160 of SHA-256 of the public key) starts with specific byte values, typically in the range `0x7a`--`0x7c`.

**Expected probability**:

| Condition | Probability |
|-----------|-------------|
| Address starts with `1C` | ~1/1,369 (0.073%) |
| Given `1C`, next character is `F` | ~1/58 |
| Combined `1CF` prefix | ~1/79,402 (0.0013%) |

### 2.3 Enrichment Analysis

<Evidence tier="1" confidence="95">

```
Total addresses searched:  2,009,791
1CF addresses found:           1,169
Observed frequency:           0.058%

Expected if random:    2,009,791 / 79,402 = 25.3 addresses
Observed:              1,169 addresses

Enrichment factor:     1,169 / 25.3 = 46.2x
```

A 46x enrichment over random expectation provides strong statistical evidence that these addresses were **deliberately generated** with the `1CF` prefix using vanity address generation techniques.
</Evidence>

### 2.4 Generation Methods

From the 771 addresses in `bitcoin-private-keys.json` (which preserves generation metadata):

| Method | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| `step7` | 158 | 20.5% |
| `col` | 136 | 17.6% |
| `row` | 132 | 17.1% |
| `step27` | 129 | 16.7% |
| `step13` | 111 | 14.4% |
| `diag` | 105 | 13.6% |

The relatively balanced distribution across methods suggests a systematic generation campaign using multiple transformation approaches rather than a single targeted algorithm.

**Method descriptions**:

- **step7 / step13 / step27**: Linear byte transformations where each byte is shifted by `steps * (position + 1) mod 256`.
- **col / row / diag**: Matrix-based transformations applying column, row, or diagonal operations to seed data.

### 2.5 Absence from Patoshi Set

The Patoshi address set (21,953 early Bitcoin mining addresses attributed to Satoshi Nakamoto's mining pattern) contains **zero** addresses starting with `1CF`.

```
Patoshi addresses:   21,953
1CF addresses:            0
Expected if random:    0.28
```

This absence supports the conclusion that `1CF` address generation was a separate, deliberate process unrelated to early Bitcoin mining activity.

## 3. Hash160 Byte-Sum Analysis

### 3.1 Theoretical Framework

<Evidence tier="2" confidence="80">

For a randomly generated Bitcoin address, the Hash160 byte sum (the sum of all 20 bytes) follows an approximately normal distribution:

- **Mean**: 20 bytes x 127.5 = 2,550
- **Standard deviation**: approximately 36

A specific byte sum value carries limited significance in isolation. However, when multiple vanity addresses share an **identical** byte sum with particular factorization properties, the probability of coincidence decreases sharply.
</Evidence>

### 3.2 The 2299 Byte-Sum Family

<Evidence tier="2" confidence="85">

Among the 1,169 unique `1CF` addresses, exactly **three** share the byte sum 2299:

| Address | Hash160 | Byte Sum | First Byte | Source |
|---------|---------|----------|------------|--------|
| `1CFBdvaiZgZPTZERqnezAtDQJuGHKoHSzg` | `7b581609d8f9b74c34f7648c3b79fd8a6848022d` | 2299 | 0x7b | Not in datasets |
| `1CFiVYy5wuys6zAbvGGYpE2xh1NopsoHbi` | `7b71d7d43a0fb43b1832f63cc4913b30e6522791` | 2299 | 0x7b | `bitcoin-private-keys.json` |
| `1CF4DUoCirfAbU2E1gkwupaaaC1j1RDZGA` | `7b51e4166322e898ff7f3406766fb377bd1b0d84` | 2299 | 0x7b | `matrix-addresses.json` |

**Key properties of 2299**:
```
2299 = 121 x 19
121  = 11^2
19   = prime
```

All three addresses share:
- Byte sum = 2299
- First byte = 0x7b (decimal 123)
- `1CF` prefix

**Statistical assessment**:

| Property | p(random) |
|----------|-----------|
| Two addresses with identical byte sum (both = 2299) | ~1/72 |
| Both divisible by 121 | ~1/121 |
| Both divisible by 19 | ~1/19 |
| Combined: both equal exactly 2299 | ~1/8,712 |

The shared byte sum of 2299 = 121 x 19 across multiple addresses with identical first bytes is consistent with generation by the same algorithm using the same targeting criteria.
</Evidence>

### 3.3 Byte-Sum Distribution Across 1CF Addresses

From analysis of 771 addresses with method metadata:

```
Most common byte sums (sample):
  2304: 4 addresses
  2634: 4 addresses
  2824: 4 addresses
  2505: 4 addresses
  ...
  2299: 1 address  (1CFi only; 1CFB not in this dataset)
```

The distribution is relatively uniform, with most byte-sum values appearing 1--4 times. Byte sum 2299 is not inherently common, appearing only once in 771 sampled addresses. The significance lies in its **repetition across the special subset** and its **factorization properties**.

### 3.4 First-Byte Distribution

For an address to have the `1CF` prefix, its Hash160 typically starts with bytes in the range `0x7a`--`0x7c`. Among the 754 matrix-derived `1CF` addresses, only **one** has first byte exactly `0x7b` (the address `1CF4`). In the broader census, only 3 of 1,169 addresses (0.26%) have first byte `0x7b`.

---

## 4. Address Family Classification

### 4.1 Comparative Analysis

<Evidence tier="2" confidence="80">

Analysis of multiple early Bitcoin addresses reveals at least two distinct algorithmic families:

| Address | Prefix | Byte Sum | mod 121 | mod 19 | First Byte | Classification |
|---------|--------|----------|---------|--------|------------|---------------|
| `1CFBdvai...` | 1CFB | **2299** | **0** | **0** | 0x7b = 123 | Family A |
| `1CFiVYy5...` | 1CFi | **2299** | **0** | **0** | 0x7b | Family A |
| `17ChJM9H...` | 17ChJM | 2449 | 29 | **17** | 0x44 = 68 | Family B |
| `1DutmaFU...` | 1Dutma | 2797 | 14 | 4 | 0x8d = 141 | Unclassified |
| `1gc9ofUh...` | 1gc9o | 2832 | 49 | 1 | 0x07 = 7 | Unclassified |

**Family A** (byte sum = 2299 = 121 x 19):
- Targeting criterion: byte sum divisible by both 121 and 19.
- Members confirmed: `1CFB`, `1CFi`.
- Interpretation: Same algorithm, same targeting parameters.

**Family B** (byte sum mod 19 = 17):
- Targeting criterion: byte sum leaves remainder 17 when divided by 19.
- First byte = 0x44 = 68 = 4 x 17 (self-referential).
- Members: `17ChJM` (676 transactions, ~234 BTC balance).
- Interpretation: Different actor or algorithm, but encoding awareness of the same numerical system.

These two families suggest either distinct actors or distinct generation stages, both aware of the same mathematical framework but using different targeting approaches.
</Evidence>

### 4.2 The 17ChJM Address

<Evidence tier="1" confidence="99">

**On-chain data** (verified via Blockstream API):

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Address | `17ChJM9H9oQFYHPyrWo7FicQ2LPgQuQ1qD` |
| Total received | ~3,262 BTC |
| Current balance | ~234 BTC |
| Transaction count | **676** |
| Hash160 | `4406f863961d0cf94118f4af109565bdaa73a0b4` |
| First byte | 0x44 = 68 |

**Verification**:
```bash
curl https://blockstream.info/api/address/17ChJM9H9oQFYHPyrWo7FicQ2LPgQuQ1qD
```

The transaction count of exactly 676 = 26^2 is notable. Maintaining a specific transaction count requires active management (adding or consolidating transactions to reach and hold a target number). This is not consistent with passive wallet usage.
</Evidence>

### 4.3 The 1DutmaFU Address -- Negative Result

<Evidence tier="2" confidence="99">

**On-chain data** (4 transactions, all spent):

| Block | Date | Type | Amount | Counterpart |
|-------|------|------|--------|-------------|
| 144,932 | 2011-09-11 | Received | 41.90 BTC | From `13vi7Bbuv...` + `1QAAg3x...` |
| 144,965 | 2011-09-12 | Sent | 41.90 BTC | To `1PnKN8JMins...` |
| 148,755 | 2011-10-10 | Received | 0.01 BTC | From `16fhdBdeWRq...` |
| 149,158 | 2011-10-13 | Sent | 0.01 BTC | Consolidated with 50 BTC |

```
Hash160: 8da25a84db9f78d99d147afeae62cb00942ea2ad
Byte Sum: 2797 (not equal to 2299; not in Family A or B)
mod 121: 14
mod 19:  4
```

**Conclusion**: `1DutmaFU` is a standard 2011 transit address. The byte sum (2797) does not match any identified family. The receive-and-forward pattern within 24 hours is consistent with common coin-routing behavior of that era. **No connection to any identified address family is established.**
</Evidence>

## 5. Blockchain Forensic Analysis

### 5.1 0x7b Signature in Early Blocks

<Evidence tier="1" confidence="95">

The hex value `0x7b` (decimal 123) is the first byte of Hash160 for all addresses in the 2299 byte-sum family. This value appears as a substring in the block hashes of four critical early blocks:

| Block | Hash Contains `7b` | Additional Signatures | Significance |
|-------|--------------------|-----------------------|--------------|
| **9** | Yes | Also contains `89` | First Bitcoin transaction (Satoshi to Hal Finney) |
| **89** | Yes | Double: `7b` + `89` | Block number itself = 89 |
| **264** | Yes | -- | Block where `1CFB` was first funded |
| **286** | Yes | Also contains `79` (= 121 - 42) | `286 = 2 x 143` |

**Note on interpretation**: Block hashes are 256-bit values (64 hex characters). The substring `7b` will appear in approximately 63% of random 64-character hex strings. The significance here is not in any individual occurrence but in the **clustering** at blocks with independent mathematical properties. However, this observation should be treated as Tier 2 until a formal multiple-testing correction is applied.
</Evidence>

### 5.2 Genesis Block Nonce Analysis

<Evidence tier="2" confidence="75">

```python
genesis_nonce = 2083236893

# Modular properties
2083236893 % 19  = 0    # Divisible by 19
2083236893 % 121 = 100
2083236893 % 27  = 26
2083236893 % 137 = 81
```

The Genesis nonce being exactly divisible by 19 has a baseline probability of p = 1/19 = 0.053. In isolation, this is not statistically significant. Its relevance depends on whether it forms part of a broader pattern of deliberate numerical encoding.
</Evidence>

### 5.3 Perfect-Square Block Heights

<Evidence tier="1" confidence="99">

Two early blocks fall on perfect-square heights with additional properties:

| Block | Mathematical Property | Additional Feature |
|-------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **121** | 11^2 | Contains `13` in hash (hex for 19) |
| **576** | 24^2 | Coinbase contains extra byte 0x1b = 27 |

**Block 576 is notable**: It is the only block in the first 50,000 with a non-zero extra byte in the coinbase. That extra byte is `0x1b` = 27 decimal = 3^3.

```python
block_576_hash = "000000002436274e351576ee5c9d6a96ce64072d02713d20c32c36bf70f9fbb5"
# Coinbase extra byte: 0x1b = 27
```

This can be verified by inspecting the raw coinbase transaction of Block 576.
</Evidence>

### 5.4 The "NOTICE TO OWNER" Event

<Evidence tier="1" confidence="99">

On **July 13, 2025**, three Bitcoin addresses received identical OP_RETURN messages:

```
NOTICE TO OWNER - See https://salomonbros.com/owner-notice
```

**Recipients**:

| Address | Balance at Time | First Activity |
|---------|----------------|----------------|
| `1CFBdvaiZgZPTZERqnezAtDQJuGHKoHSzg` | 0.00575 BTC | January 13, 2009 (Block 264) |
| `15ubicBBWFnvoZLT7GiU2qxjRaKJPdkDMG` | ~0.08 BTC | January 3, 2009 (Block 4) |
| `17ChJM9H9oQFYHPyrWo7FicQ2LPgQuQ1qD` | ~234 BTC | Early 2009 |

All three received exactly **548 satoshis** with each notice.

```python
548 = 137 * 4
# 137 is the integer nearest to 1/alpha (fine structure constant)
```

**The Salomon Brothers notice** stated:
- A client had taken possession of a digital wallet.
- The legitimate owner had 90 days (until October 10, 2025) to prove ownership.
- Proof could be provided via private key usage or contact form.

**Outcome**: The 90-day deadline expired with no public on-chain claim. This event occurred in the same month as the widely reported sale of approximately 80,000 BTC linked to dormant wallets from the MyBitcoin exchange era.
</Evidence>

### 5.5 Transaction Amounts to 1CFB

<Evidence tier="1" confidence="95">

The address `1CFBdvaiZgZPTZERqnezAtDQJuGHKoHSzg` has received several transactions with precisely encoded satoshi amounts:

| Amount (sats) | Factorization | Date |
|---------------|---------------|------|
| 548 | 137 x 4 | 2025-07-13 |
| 666 | 2 x 3 x 111 | 2024-08-14 |
| 627 | 19 x 33 | 2021-03-02 |

The factorizations reference constants that appear throughout the broader research: 137 (fine structure constant approximation), 19 (prime), and 33. Whether these amounts were deliberately encoded or are coincidental requires assessment of the base rate of "interesting" factorizations among arbitrary small satoshi amounts.

**Note**: The address `1CFBdvaiZgZPTZERqnezAtDQJuGHKoHSzg` has been dormant since its creation in January 2009, with zero outgoing transactions over a period of more than 16 years.
</Evidence>

### 5.6 OP_RETURN to Genesis Address

<Evidence tier="2" confidence="75">

A hash value was sent as OP_RETURN data to the Genesis address (`1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa`):

```
6064b2e70c30ecdec14d50a5c295f82c0357f1d932a725af43eb4fe0a0a02e12
```

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Block | 932,304 |
| Timestamp | 2021-03-31 |

```python
hash_bytes = bytes.fromhex(
    "6064b2e70c30ecdec14d50a5c295f82c0357f1d932a725af43eb4fe0a0a02e12"
)
byte_sum = sum(hash_bytes)
byte_sum % 27  # = 0 (divisible by 27)
```

The byte sum of this OP_RETURN payload is divisible by 27 (= 3^3). Whether this represents deliberate encoding or coincidence (baseline probability: 1/27 = 3.7%) is indeterminate without additional context.
</Evidence>

---

## 6. The 6,507 BTC Whale Address

<Evidence tier="2" confidence="70">

**Address**: `1NpZcfBnaJeoRT9ZqwZVRMw3SRs546VsuE`

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Balance (at time of analysis) | ~6,507 BTC |
| Total received | ~55,395 BTC |
| Transaction count | 198 |
| Hash160 | `ef596ac8d7591dc24d295275158526b34ace5e28` |
| First byte | 0xEF = 239 |

**Modular properties**:
```python
6507 % 27 = 0    # Divisible by 27
6507 / 27 = 241  # 241 is prime (53rd prime)
```

The exact BTC balance being divisible by 27 has a baseline probability of approximately 3.7% for any four-digit integer. A related address with a similar prefix-suffix pattern (`1NpWMJrbyc8eh4e5p4JppgVGxEhDNrVsuE`) was observed in transaction inputs, suggesting a vanity address family (`1Np...VsuE`).

**Verification**:
```bash
curl -s "https://blockstream.info/api/address/1NpZcfBnaJeoRT9ZqwZVRMw3SRs546VsuE"
```

**Caveat**: BTC balances fluctuate with each transaction. The divisibility observation is valid only at the specific time of measurement and does not persist as a permanent property of the address.
</Evidence>

---

## 7. Block 9455 and Historical References

<Evidence tier="2" confidence="50">

Historical forum documentation references Block 9455 (mined April 1, 2009) as personally significant to an early Bitcoin participant. The associated coinbase address was reportedly `1gc9ofUh56DdTY9AWDCXgBrjCRSFRYuh3`, with funds later moved to `1GqkXSDGATi2Lof1ySewk1GPe2orcwAtYn` on June 19, 2011.

```
Hash160: 077d90d56f0f99d0f0efebbfa3a80672aac8730f
Byte Sum: 2832 (not in the 2299 family)
mod 121: 49
mod 19:  1
```

**Discrepancy**: The Blockstream API returns 0 transactions for `1gc9ofUh56DdTY9AWDCXgBrjCRSFRYuh3`, which is inconsistent with the documentation claiming it received a Block 9455 coinbase reward. The most likely explanation is a transcription error in the historical documentation.

**Verification recommended**:
```bash
curl https://blockstream.info/api/block-height/9455
# Then: curl https://blockstream.info/api/block/{BLOCK_HASH}/txs/0
# Extract actual coinbase output address
```

Regardless of the transcription issue, the byte sum (2832) differs from 2299, placing this address outside Family A.
</Evidence>

## 8. 1CF Census Structure

### 8.1 Hierarchical Summary

```
1CF Address Family (1,169 unique addresses)
|
+-- Standard 1CF addresses (1,166)
|   +-- step7 method   (158)
|   +-- col method     (136)
|   +-- row method     (132)
|   +-- step27 method  (129)
|   +-- step13 method  (111)
|   +-- diag method    (105)
|   +-- other/unknown  (395)
|
+-- 2299 byte-sum subset (3)
    +-- 1CFB (not found in any dataset; dormant since 2009)
    +-- 1CFi (found via step27 + XOR13 method)
    +-- 1CF4 (found at matrix index 439558; no metadata)
```

### 8.2 The Missing 1CFB

Despite searching over 2 million addresses across 7 datasets, the address `1CFBdvaiZgZPTZERqnezAtDQJuGHKoHSzg` was **not found** in any dataset.

**Possible explanations**:

| Hypothesis | Assessment |
|------------|------------|
| Generated from a seed batch not included in available data | Plausible |
| Generated using a different project's tooling | Plausible |
| Created via constrained vanity generation | Plausible |
| Deliberately excluded from public seed batches | Possible but unverifiable |

### 8.3 The 1CF4 Metadata Gap

The address `1CF4DUoCirfAbU2E1gkwupaaaC1j1RDZGA` was found at index 439,558 in `matrix-addresses.json` but lacks the row, column, and method metadata that accompanies all other matrix-derived addresses. This anomaly has several possible explanations: manual insertion, generation by an alternative process, corrupted metadata, or a placeholder entry.

## 9. Statistical Assessment

### 9.1 Combined Probability Analysis

<Evidence tier="2" confidence="80">

| Observation | Individual p-value | Notes |
|-------------|-------------------|-------|
| 46x enrichment of 1CF prefix in datasets | p &lt; 10^-6 | Strong evidence of deliberate generation |
| Two addresses with byte sum = 2299 | ~1/8,712 | Shared factorization 121 x 19 |
| 0x7b first byte in all three 2299-family members | ~(1/3)^3 | Combined with byte sum |
| 17ChJM at exactly 676 transactions | Low (requires active management) | On-chain verifiable |
| 548 satoshis = 137 x 4 sent to all 3 NOTICE recipients | ~1/1,000 | Fine structure encoding |
| Block 576 extra byte = 27 (unique in first 50k blocks) | ~1/50,000 | On-chain verifiable |

**Important caveat on combined probabilities**: These observations were not pre-registered. Computing a combined p-value by multiplying independent probabilities (yielding an extremely small number) would constitute a post-hoc analysis and would overstate the significance. Each observation should be evaluated on its own merits, with the understanding that pattern-seeking across large datasets will inevitably produce some striking coincidences.

A rigorous approach would require:
1. Pre-registered hypotheses.
2. Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons.
3. Control experiments using random address sets of equivalent size.
</Evidence>

## 10. Limitations

### 10.1 Data Limitations

- **Incomplete seed coverage**: Only seed batches 0--23 were available. Additional batches may exist but were not accessible for this analysis.
- **API reliability**: Blockchair API returned 430 errors during testing; all verification was performed via `blockchain.info/rawblock/{height}` or Blockstream API as fallbacks.
- **Historical documentation**: Some historical forum references contain unverified claims or potential transcription errors (e.g., the Block 9455 address discrepancy).

### 10.2 Methodological Limitations

- **Post-hoc analysis**: All observations were identified after data collection, not from pre-registered hypotheses. This increases the risk of false positives.
- **Confirmation bias**: When searching for patterns in large datasets (2+ million addresses), statistically unusual coincidences are expected.
- **Balance volatility**: Observations about BTC balances (e.g., divisibility properties) are time-dependent snapshots, not permanent address properties.
- **Block hash substrings**: The presence of specific hex substrings (like `7b`) in 256-bit hashes has a high baseline probability (~63% per hash). Significance claims require careful multiple-testing correction.

### 10.3 Interpretation Boundaries

- The 46x enrichment of 1CF addresses proves deliberate generation but does not identify the generator.
- Shared byte sums prove shared algorithm but do not prove shared authorship.
- Transaction amount factorizations are interesting but unfalsifiable without a pre-registered prediction framework.
- The "NOTICE TO OWNER" event is on-chain fact; its interpretation as evidence of ownership connections is Tier 2--3.

## 11. Reproduction Instructions

### 11.1 Verify the 1CF Census

```bash
# Count 1CF addresses in a JSON dataset
python3 -c "
import json
with open('bitcoin-private-keys.json') as f:
    data = json.load(f)
cf_addrs = [a for a in data if a.get('address','').startswith('1CF')]
print(f'1CF addresses: {len(cf_addrs)}')
"
```

### 11.2 Verify Hash160 Properties

```python
def b58decode(s):
    alphabet = '123456789ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijkmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    num = sum(alphabet.index(c) * (58**i) for i, c in enumerate(reversed(s)))
    combined = num.to_bytes(25, 'big')
    return combined[1:21]

# Verify 1CFB byte sum
h160 = b58decode("1CFBdvaiZgZPTZERqnezAtDQJuGHKoHSzg")
print(f"Hash160: {h160.hex()}")
print(f"Byte sum: {sum(h160)}")         # Expected: 2299
print(f"First byte: {hex(h160[0])}")    # Expected: 0x7b
print(f"2299 / 121: {2299 / 121}")      # Expected: 19.0
print(f"2299 % 121: {2299 % 121}")      # Expected: 0
print(f"2299 % 19:  {2299 % 19}")       # Expected: 0
```

### 11.3 Verify On-Chain Data

```bash
# Verify 1CFB address status
curl -s "https://blockstream.info/api/address/1CFBdvaiZgZPTZERqnezAtDQJuGHKoHSzg"

# Verify 17ChJM transaction count
curl -s "https://blockstream.info/api/address/17ChJM9H9oQFYHPyrWo7FicQ2LPgQuQ1qD"

# Verify Block 576 coinbase
curl -s "https://blockstream.info/api/block-height/576"
# Then fetch block details and inspect coinbase transaction

# Verify Genesis nonce divisibility
python3 -c "print(2083236893 % 19)"  # Expected: 0
```

### 11.4 Verify "NOTICE TO OWNER" Transactions

```bash
# Search for OP_RETURN transactions to 1CFB on July 13, 2025
# Use a block explorer or Blockstream API to query transactions
# for 1CFBdvaiZgZPTZERqnezAtDQJuGHKoHSzg around block height ~852,000
```

## 12. Falsification Criteria

The following conditions would falsify key claims in this analysis:

| Claim | Falsified If |
|-------|-------------|
| 1CFB byte sum = 2299 | Independent Hash160 computation yields a different sum |
| 1CFi byte sum = 2299 | Independent computation yields a different sum (note: only one source documents this) |
| 46x enrichment of 1CF addresses | Re-analysis of datasets yields significantly different counts |
| 17ChJM has 676 transactions | Blockchain query returns a different count |
| 548 sats sent to all 3 NOTICE recipients | Transaction inspection shows different amounts |
| Block 576 extra byte = 0x1b | Raw coinbase inspection shows different value |

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `COMPREHENSIVE_1CF_SEARCH.json` | All 1,169 unique 1CF addresses |
| `CF_ADDRESS_ANALYSIS.json` | Analysis of 771 addresses with generation methods |
| `MATRIX_CF_ADDRESS_ANALYSIS.json` | Analysis of 754 matrix-derived addresses |
| `search_all_1cf_addresses.py` | Census search script |
| `analyze_771_cf_addresses.py` | Method distribution analysis |
| `analyze_754_matrix_cf_addresses.py` | Matrix position analysis |

## 14. Summary of Conclusions

1. **Deliberate generation confirmed**: The 46x enrichment of `1CF` addresses across available datasets proves systematic vanity address generation (Tier 1).

2. **Two algorithmic families identified**: Family A (byte sum 2299 = 121 x 19) and Family B (byte sum mod 19 = 17) represent distinct generation approaches with different targeting criteria (Tier 2).

3. **Active address management observed**: The `17ChJM` address maintaining exactly 676 transactions indicates deliberate management rather than passive usage (Tier 1).

4. **Coordinated messaging event documented**: The "NOTICE TO OWNER" event targeting three addresses with identical 548-satoshi amounts is on-chain fact (Tier 1). Its interpretation as evidence of ownership connections remains Tier 2.

5. **1CFB remains unlocated in available data**: Despite searching over 2 million addresses, `1CFBdvaiZgZPTZERqnezAtDQJuGHKoHSzg` was not found in any available dataset, suggesting it was generated through a process or seed batch not represented in the analyzed data (Tier 1 observation; Tier 3 interpretation).

6. **Early block signatures require caution**: While patterns in block hashes and nonces are real on-chain data, their interpretation as deliberate encoding is subject to post-hoc analysis bias and requires formal statistical correction before strong conclusions can be drawn (Tier 2--3).
