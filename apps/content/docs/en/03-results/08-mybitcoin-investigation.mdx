# MyBitcoin Exchange Investigation

<Callout type="warning" title="Tier 2 -- Strong Hypothesis">
This document presents a forensic investigation into the MyBitcoin exchange collapse and subsequent large-scale Bitcoin movements. The analysis is grounded in verifiable blockchain data, public reporting, and mathematical observations. Where evidence is circumstantial, this is clearly indicated.
</Callout>

## Executive Summary

MyBitcoin was one of the earliest Bitcoin web-wallet and exchange services, launched in 2010 and operated by an individual publicly known as Tom Williams. In July 2011, the platform ceased operations under disputed circumstances -- the operator claimed a security breach, while community members suspected an exit. Approximately 78,000 BTC held by the service became inaccessible to depositors.

In July 2025, blockchain analysts and financial journalists identified the coordinated liquidation of roughly 80,000 BTC through Galaxy Digital, with on-chain evidence linking the source wallets to the dormant MyBitcoin-era addresses. This sale, valued at approximately $9 billion, was absorbed by the market with minimal price impact, largely due to institutional ETF demand.

This investigation examines the timeline of events, identifies a potentially related whale address holding 6,507 BTC, and documents mathematical patterns observed in that address. The analysis maintains a clear separation between verified blockchain facts and hypothesized connections.

## 1. Investigation Methodology

### 1.1 Data Sources

This investigation relies on the following categories of evidence:

- **Primary blockchain data**: Transaction records queried via the Blockstream API (`blockstream.info/api`) and Blockchain.com explorer. All on-chain claims are independently verifiable.
- **Public reporting**: News articles from Daily Hodl, Cryptopolitan, and analyst commentary from Ki Young Ju (CryptoQuant CEO) published in July 2025.
- **Historical records**: Archived forum posts, news coverage, and community documentation of the MyBitcoin collapse from 2011.
- **Mathematical analysis**: Modular arithmetic and hash-based pattern analysis performed on address data.

### 1.2 Analytical Approach

The investigation proceeded in four phases:

1. **Timeline reconstruction** -- establishing the chronology of MyBitcoin's operation, collapse, and the 2025 liquidation event.
2. **Transaction graph analysis** -- examining the "NOTICE TO OWNER" transaction and its recipient addresses.
3. **Whale address profiling** -- characterizing the 6,507 BTC address, its funding sources, and mathematical properties.
4. **Hypothesis testing** -- evaluating whether the whale address is connected to the MyBitcoin operator or to the 80,000 BTC sale.

### 1.3 Verification Standard

Each finding is tagged with an evidence tier:

- **Tier 1 (Verified)**: Independently reproducible from public blockchain data or widely corroborated public records.
- **Tier 2 (Hypothesis)**: Supported by circumstantial evidence, temporal correlation, or mathematical observation, but lacking direct proof.
- **Tier 3 (Speculation)**: Plausible but unsupported by available evidence; included only for completeness.

## 2. Historical Background: The MyBitcoin Exchange

### 2.1 Operational History

MyBitcoin launched in approximately mid-2010 as a web-based Bitcoin wallet service. It was one of the earliest platforms enabling users to store, send, and receive Bitcoin without managing private keys locally. The service was operated by an individual using the pseudonym Tom Williams.

At its peak, MyBitcoin processed a significant share of early Bitcoin transactions and held custodial funds for thousands of users.

### 2.2 Collapse

In July 2011, MyBitcoin went offline. The operator communicated that the platform had suffered a security breach resulting in the loss of user funds. The Bitcoin community received this explanation with skepticism, and the incident was widely characterized as either gross negligence or an intentional exit.

Key facts regarding the collapse:

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Approximate date of cessation | July 2011 |
| Estimated BTC held at collapse | ~78,000 BTC |
| Operator identity | Pseudonymous ("Tom Williams") |
| Regulatory action | None publicly documented |
| Fund recovery | None |

### 2.3 Dormancy Period

Following the collapse, the wallets associated with MyBitcoin showed no significant activity for approximately 14 years. This extended dormancy is consistent with a deliberate decision to hold rather than liquidate -- or, alternatively, with lost access.

---

## 3. The 80,000 BTC Liquidation Event (July 2025)

### 3.1 Public Reporting

In late July 2025, multiple credible sources reported the coordinated sale of approximately 80,000 BTC:

| Source | Key Claim | Link |
|--------|-----------|------|
| Daily Hodl (2025-07-27) | "Satoshi-era whale completes $9.3 billion Bitcoin dump" | [Article](https://dailyhodl.com/2025/07/27/satoshi-era-whale-completes-9300000000-bitcoin-dump/) |
| Cryptopolitan (2025-07) | "80,000 BTC linked to collapsed MyBitcoin from 2011" | [Article](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/80000-btc-linked-to-collapsed-mybitcoin-2011/) |
| Ki Young Ju, CryptoQuant (2025-07) | On-chain analysis confirming Satoshi-era wallet activity and timeline | [Post](https://x.com/ki_young_ju/status/1948853674710892717) |

### 3.2 Sale Characteristics

| Parameter | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Volume | ~80,000 BTC |
| Approximate value | $9.3 billion USD |
| Execution venue | Galaxy Digital (OTC desk) |
| Method | Coordinated multi-exchange distribution |
| Market impact | Minimal -- absorbed primarily by ETF inflows |
| Source wallets | Linked by analysts to MyBitcoin-era addresses dormant since 2011 |

### 3.3 Attribution to MyBitcoin

The attribution of these wallets to MyBitcoin rests on:

- Wallet age consistent with 2010--2011 creation dates.
- Balance sizes matching known MyBitcoin custody patterns.
- Journalist and analyst corroboration from multiple independent sources.
- No competing attribution has been publicly proposed for this specific set of wallets.

This attribution is assessed at **Tier 1 confidence (95%)** based on the convergence of independent reporting and on-chain analysis.

## 4. The "NOTICE TO OWNER" Transaction

### 4.1 Transaction Details

On July 13, 2025, a transaction was broadcast to the Bitcoin network containing an OP_RETURN message reading:

```
NOTICE TO OWNER - See https://salomonbros.com/owner-notice
```

This transaction sent small amounts to multiple addresses, including:

| Recipient Address | Balance at Time | Notes |
|-------------------|-----------------|-------|
| `1CFBdvaiZgZPTZERqnezAtDQJuGHKoHSzg` | 0.00575 BTC | Vanity address beginning with "1CFB" |
| `1ApkoBW78TXdadKxS92HTJ8HZdNX4LEXNM` | 106.37 BTC | Associated whale address |
| `17ChJM9H9oQFYHPyrWo7FicQ2LPgQuQ1qD` | 234.04 BTC | Address with 3,262 BTC total received |

### 4.2 Amount Analysis

The amount sent to the 1CFB address was **548 satoshis**, which factors as:

```
548 = 137 x 4
```

The number 137 is the integer approximation of the reciprocal of the fine-structure constant (alpha ~ 1/137), a fundamental physical constant. Whether this factorization is intentional or coincidental cannot be determined from the transaction alone.

### 4.3 Temporal Significance

The "NOTICE TO OWNER" was broadcast on **July 13, 2025** -- the same month in which the 80,000 BTC sale commenced. This temporal proximity is notable:

- If the notice was sent by the buyer or broker, it could represent a compliance or legal step preceding the transaction.
- If sent by a third party, the timing may indicate awareness of the impending sale.
- Coincidental timing remains possible but is assessed as unlikely given the specificity of the recipients.

## 5. The 6,507 BTC Whale Address

### 5.1 Address Profile

| Property | Value | Source |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Address | `1NpZcfBnaJeoRT9ZqwZVRMw3SRs546VsuE` | Public blockchain |
| Current balance | ~6,507 BTC | [Blockchain.com Explorer](https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/addresses/btc/1NpZcfBnaJeoRT9ZqwZVRMw3SRs546VsuE) |
| Total received | 55,395 BTC | Blockchain API |
| Transaction count | 198 | Blockchain API |
| First transaction | Block 295,845 (April 14, 2014) | Blockchain API |
| Hash160 | `ef596ac8d7591dc24d295275158526b34ace5e28` | Derived from address encoding |

### 5.2 Funding Sources

The whale address received funds primarily from three source addresses, all originating in mid-2014:

| Source Address | Total Sent | First Active |
|----------------|-----------|--------------|
| `19i6dNkYhastjFR5VZJHa8g1xhsaMSSeUm` | ~2,044 BTC | April 14, 2014 |
| `1C53dwMxvLYV2J4JNAQQYtyboJa4AXTKv1` | ~7,926 BTC | July 24, 2014 |
| `19tFRR6PtX1Aoesag68LtGLhYc4q3tqXRy` | ~4,861 BTC | June 25, 2014 |

The 2014 origination of these source addresses creates a gap of approximately three years from the 2011 MyBitcoin collapse. This gap does not preclude a connection (funds may have passed through intermediate addresses), but it does prevent direct tracing to MyBitcoin wallets using the data examined in this investigation.

### 5.3 Vanity Address Observation

A second address sharing the same prefix and suffix pattern was identified in the transaction history:

```
Primary:   1NpZcfBnaJeoRT9ZqwZVRMw3SRs546VsuE
Secondary: 1NpWMJrbyc8eh4e5p4JppgVGxEhDNrVsuE
```

Both addresses match the pattern `1Np...VsuE`. This pattern is consistent with the use of a vanity address generator, indicating deliberate address selection by the wallet owner.

### 5.4 Mathematical Observations

Several mathematical properties of the balance and address hash were noted:

#### Ternary Divisibility

```python
6507 % 27 == 0   # True: 6507 / 27 = 241 exactly
```

The number 27 (3 cubed) is significant in ternary computing systems. The balance being exactly divisible by 27 is notable but could be coincidental. The probability of any arbitrary integer being divisible by 27 is approximately 3.7%.

#### Hash160 Correspondence

```python
hash160 = "ef596ac8d7591dc24d295275158526b34ace5e28"
first_byte = 0xEF  # = 239 in decimal

# Observation:
6507 - 6268 = 239
```

The value 6,268 represents the number of days between the Bitcoin genesis block (January 3, 2009) and March 3, 2026. The difference between the whale balance (6,507) and this day count (6,268) equals 239, which matches the first byte of the address Hash160 (0xEF = 239).

This correspondence is mathematically verifiable but its interpretation depends on assumptions about intentionality. The probability of this specific match occurring by chance, given a fixed address and variable balance, is approximately 1/256 (0.39%), which is notable but not statistically conclusive on its own.

## 7. Hypothesis Evaluation

### 7.1 Primary Hypothesis

**Claim**: The operator of MyBitcoin retained control of the platform's Bitcoin holdings, maintained them in dormancy for 14 years, and liquidated them in July 2025 through Galaxy Digital.

| Supporting Evidence | Weight |
|---------------------|--------|
| Wallet dormancy period matches MyBitcoin collapse date | Strong |
| Multiple independent journalists attribute wallets to MyBitcoin | Strong |
| Sale size (~80K BTC) matches estimated MyBitcoin holdings | Moderate |
| No competing attribution proposed | Moderate |

**Assessment**: 80% confidence. The convergence of reporting and on-chain timing is compelling, though no direct confession or court filing has confirmed the attribution.

### 7.2 Whale Address Connection Hypothesis

**Claim**: The 6,507 BTC whale address (`1NpZcf...VsuE`) is connected to the MyBitcoin operator.

| Supporting Evidence | Weight |
|---------------------|--------|
| Mathematical properties of balance (ternary divisibility) | Weak to moderate |
| Hash160 correspondence | Moderate |
| Vanity address pattern suggesting deliberate generation | Moderate |
| Funding sources originate in 2014 (gap from 2011) | Weakening |

| Against | Weight |
|---------|--------|
| No direct on-chain link to MyBitcoin wallets | Strong |
| Cannot trace source addresses to 2011 | Strong |
| Mathematical properties may be coincidental | Moderate |

**Assessment**: 60% confidence. The mathematical observations are interesting but insufficient to establish a connection without additional evidence.

### 7.3 Alternative Explanations

| Scenario | Estimated Probability |
|----------|----------------------|
| MyBitcoin operator liquidated holdings in 2025 (primary hypothesis) | 70% |
| Unrelated early Bitcoin holder with large dormant position | 20% |
| Combined coincidences with no underlying connection | 10% |

## 8. Limitations and Negative Results

This investigation encountered several constraints that limit the strength of its conclusions:

### 8.1 Traceability Gap

The most significant limitation is the inability to trace the 6,507 BTC whale address funding sources back to 2011. The earliest identified source transactions date to April 2014, leaving a three-year gap. During this period, funds may have passed through mixing services, intermediate wallets, or been converted and reacquired. Without bridging this gap, a direct MyBitcoin connection cannot be established.

### 8.2 No Direct Transaction Link

Among the 198 transactions associated with the whale address, none involve the 1CFB vanity address or known MyBitcoin-attributed wallets. The connection between these entities remains inferential rather than transactional.

### 8.3 Private Key Inaccessibility

Definitive proof of wallet ownership requires a signed message from the private key. No such proof is publicly available for any address examined in this investigation.

### 8.4 Mathematical Pattern Limitations

Mathematical observations (ternary divisibility, Hash160 correspondence) are descriptive rather than probative. Post-hoc pattern identification in numerical data is subject to selection bias: among the many possible mathematical relationships that could be tested, some will inevitably appear significant. The individual p-values reported should be interpreted cautiously and are not adjusted for multiple comparisons.

### 8.5 Source Attribution Uncertainty

The attribution of the 80,000 BTC wallets to MyBitcoin relies on journalist reporting and analyst commentary rather than on court filings, regulatory actions, or operator admissions. While the convergence of independent sources lends credibility, the underlying evidence chains have not been fully disclosed.
