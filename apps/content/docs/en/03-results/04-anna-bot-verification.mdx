# Anna Bot Algorithm Verification

## Executive Summary

This document presents a comprehensive technical verification of the Anna Bot algorithm operating within the Aigarth system on Qubic. Through systematic reverse-engineering and statistical analysis of 897 bot responses collected across eight batches, we determined that the Anna Bot implements a **deterministic coordinate-based lookup table** rather than a real-time neural computation engine.

The core algorithm applies a coordinate transformation to map user-supplied `(x, y)` inputs onto indices of a pre-computed 128x128 signed-byte matrix. The transformation was verified with **100% accuracy** against an initial test set of 142 independently collected responses, and subsequent validation across the full 897-response corpus confirmed its correctness without exception.

Additionally, the matrix exhibits **99.58% point symmetry**, with only 68 cells deviating from the symmetry rule. These asymmetric cells encode extractable ASCII messages, including a Fibonacci pointer sequence and an embedded signature string.

<Callout type="info" title="Classification Note">
The Anna Bot is a **lookup table with a coordinate transformation**. It is not a neural network, not an artificial general intelligence system, and does not perform real-time computation. All outputs are pre-stored matrix values retrieved via index arithmetic.

## Algorithm Description

### Coordinate Transformation

The Anna Bot accepts integer coordinate pairs `(x, y)` where `x` ranges from -64 to +63 and `y` ranges from +63 to -64 (inverted vertical axis). These coordinates are transformed to matrix indices using the following formula:

```python
row = (63 - y) % 128
col = (x + 64) % 128
value = matrix[row][col]
```

The bot returns `value` as its response. No further computation, filtering, or transformation is applied.

### Coordinate System Mapping

| System | X-Axis | Y-Axis | Origin |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Anna (input)** | -64 to +63 | +63 to -64 (inverted) | (0, 0) = center |
| **Matrix (storage)** | 0 to 127 | 0 to 127 | [0, 0] = top-left |

### Reference Mappings

| Anna Coordinates | Matrix Position | Returned Value |
|------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| (0, 0) Center | [63, 64] | -40 |
| (-64, 63) Top-Left | [0, 0] | -68 |
| (63, -64) Bottom-Right | [127, 127] | 67 |
| (6, 33) | [30, 70] | -93 |
| (-42, 41) | [22, 22] | 100 |

### Reference Implementation

```python
def anna_to_matrix(x: int, y: int) -> tuple[int, int]:
    """Convert Anna coordinates to matrix indices."""
    col = (x + 64) % 128
    row = (63 - y) % 128
    return row, col

def matrix_to_anna(row: int, col: int) -> tuple[int, int]:
    """Convert matrix indices to Anna coordinates."""
    x = col - 64
    if x > 63:
        x -= 128
    y = 63 - row
    if y < -64:
        y += 128
    return x, y

class AnnaMatrix:
    def __init__(self, matrix_data: list[list[int]]):
        self.matrix = matrix_data

    def lookup(self, x: int, y: int) -> int:
        """Perform Anna Bot lookup with verified coordinate transformation."""
        row, col = anna_to_matrix(x, y)
        return self.matrix[row][col]
```

### Usage Example

```python
anna = AnnaMatrix(matrix_data)

# Verified lookups
assert anna.lookup(0, 0)    == -40   # Center
assert anna.lookup(49, 5)   == -114  # High-collision coordinate
assert anna.lookup(-42, 41) == 100   # XOR triangle center
assert anna.lookup(6, 33)   == -93   # Core node
```

## Verification Methodology

### Phase 1: Data Collection

Data was gathered in two stages:

1. **Initial corpus** (142 responses): Collected from publicly available Anna Bot responses on Twitter/X (@anna_aigarth). Each response followed the format `x+y=value`, including negative coordinates.
2. **Extended corpus** (897 responses across 8 batches): Systematic exploration of the coordinate space using targeted queries, hypothesis-driven probes, and edge-case verification.

### Phase 2: Formula Search

Over 70 candidate transformation formulas were tested against the 142-response initial corpus:

- Direct mappings: `(x, y)`, `(y, x)`
- Offset transformations: `+32`, `+64`, `+96`, etc.
- Mirror operations: `127-x`, `127-y`
- Modular arithmetic variants
- Bitwise operations: XOR, AND
- Neural network forward-pass simulations

**Only one formula achieved 100% accuracy**:

```
row = (63 - y) % 128
col = (x + 64) % 128
```

All 142 responses matched without error.

### Phase 3: Extended Validation

The verified formula was then applied to the full 897-response corpus. Every response was confirmed to match the matrix lookup value at the transformed coordinates. No exceptions were found.

### Phase 4: Statistical Analysis

To quantify the non-randomness of value distributions across the matrix, a chi-square goodness-of-fit test was applied:

```python
from scipy.stats import chisquare

expected_frequency = len(responses) / len(unique_values)
observed_frequencies = [len(coords) for coords in collision_groups.values()]
chi2, p_value = chisquare(observed_frequencies, [expected_frequency] * len(observed_frequencies))
# Result: p_value < 10^-500
```

The null hypothesis that collision values are uniformly distributed was rejected with extreme significance.

## Results

### 1. Value Distribution Analysis

Across 897 responses, more than 70 distinct output values were observed. The distribution is highly non-uniform:

| Rank | Value | Occurrences | Notable Property |
|------|-------|-------------|------------------|
| 1 | -114 | 40 | Most frequent collision value |
| 2 | -113 | 34 | Prime number |
| 3 | 78 | 20 | - |
| 4 | 10 | 20 | - |
| 5 | 26 | 19 | = 128 / ~5 |
| 6 | -121 | 18 | Universal column value |
| 7 | 14 | 32+ | Row 49 dominant output |
| 8 | -50 | 13 | - |
| 9 | 111 | 13 | = 3 x 37 |
| 10 | 125 | 10+ | - |

The probability of observing this distribution under a uniform random model is below 10^-500, confirming intentional structure.

### 2. Row-Level Behavioral Patterns

Individual rows exhibit distinct output profiles. Rows sharing the same `row % 8` residue class show broad tendencies, but the exact row number determines specific behavior:

| Row | row%8 | Dominant Output | Frequency on Row |
|-----|-------|-----------------|------------------|
| 1 | 1 | -114 | High |
| 9 | 1 | 125 | High |
| 49 (= 7^2) | 1 | 14 (= 2 x 7) | 14 coordinates |
| 57 (= 3 x 19) | 1 | 6 | 6 coordinates, zero -114 |

**Residue class tendencies** (approximate, not deterministic):

| row%8 Class | Tendency | Reliability |
|-------------|----------|-------------|
| 3, 7 | Produces -113 frequently | ~70% |
| 4 | Produces 111 on columns {12, 15, 28} | ~65% |
| 2, 6 | Produces -117 commonly | ~60% |

**Important**: These are statistical tendencies, not deterministic rules. Each row has its own collision profile.

### 3. Universal Columns

Three columns produce the same output value regardless of the row. These were verified against all 128 rows:

| Column | Output Value | Verification |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| 28 | 110 | All 128 rows tested |
| 34 | 60 | All 128 rows tested |
| -17 (= 111 in matrix) | -121 | All 128 rows tested |

A hypothesis that all multiples of 7 would be universal was tested and **rejected**. Columns 14, 35, 42, and 56 do not exhibit universal behavior.

### 4. Matrix Symmetry

The 128x128 matrix exhibits near-perfect point symmetry around the position (-0.5, -0.5) in Anna coordinates:

```
Anna(x, y) + Anna(-1 - x, -1 - y) = -1
```

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Total possible pairs | 8,192 |
| Symmetric pairs | 8,158 |
| Asymmetric pairs | 34 |
| Symmetry rate | **99.58%** |
| Asymmetric cells | 68 |

The 34 pairs (68 cells) that violate the symmetry rule are concentrated in four column pairs, all summing to 127:

| Column Pair | Sum | Asymmetric Pairs | Content |
|-------------|-----|-------------------|---------|
| (22, 105) | 127 | 13 | Fibonacci pointer |
| (30, 97) | 127 | 18 | ASCII signature |
| (0, 127) | 127 | 1 | - |
| (41, 86) | 127 | 2 | XOR triangle vertex |

### 5. Embedded Messages

XOR operations applied to asymmetric cell pairs yield ASCII-decodable sequences:

#### Column Pair (22, 105): Fibonacci Pointer

```
Row 27: 120 XOR 70  = 62 = '>'
Row 28:  40 XOR 110 = 70 = 'F'
Row 29: -121 XOR -50 = 73 = 'I'
Row 30:  44 XOR 110 = 66 = 'B'
```

**Decoded string**: `>FIB` -- interpreted as a pointer to Fibonacci-related structure within the matrix.

#### Column Pair (30, 97): Signature String

The complete XOR extraction from the 18 asymmetric pairs in this column pair yields fragments including:

- `AI.MEG`
- `GOU`
- Bracket characters `{` and `}`

#### XOR Triangle Center

At Anna coordinates (-42, 41) and (41, -42), both positions return the value 100. Their XOR produces 0 (null character). This is the only asymmetric pair where both cells hold equal values.

## Prediction Capabilities

Based on the verified algorithm and 897-response analysis, Anna Bot outputs can be predicted at varying confidence levels:

### Deterministic Predictions (100% accuracy)

- Any coordinate can be resolved by direct matrix lookup using the verified formula.
- Universal columns (28, 34, -17) always return their fixed values.

### Pattern-Based Predictions (70-75% accuracy)

Without direct matrix access, row-level and residue-class patterns allow approximate prediction:

- **Row-specific dominance**: Row 1 tends toward -114; Row 49 toward 14; Row 57 toward 6.
- **Residue class tendencies**: row%8 in {3, 7} correlates with -113 output.
- **Column-specific patterns**: row%8 = 4 on columns {12, 15, 28} correlates with output 111.

These heuristic predictions achieve approximately 70-75% accuracy across the tested coordinate space.

## Limitations and Caveats

### Verified Claims

The following are fully verified with 100% confidence:

1. The coordinate transformation formula reproduces all observed Anna Bot outputs.
2. The bot performs direct matrix lookup, not real-time computation.
3. The matrix has 99.58% point symmetry with 68 asymmetric cells.
4. Value distributions are non-random (p < 10^-500).

### Acknowledged Limitations

1. **Corpus coverage**: 897 responses cover approximately 5.5% of the 16,384-cell matrix. Unsampled regions may contain patterns not captured by current analysis.
2. **Temporal stability**: All data was collected within a bounded time window. Whether the matrix is static or subject to periodic updates has not been confirmed through long-term monitoring.
3. **Message interpretation**: The decoded ASCII fragments (">FIB", "AI.MEG", "GOU") are presented as extracted data. Their intended meaning remains a matter of interpretation.
4. **Prediction accuracy bounds**: The 70-75% pattern-based prediction estimate is derived from the sampled corpus and may not generalize uniformly across the full coordinate space.
5. **Causal claims**: The presence of structured patterns in the matrix confirms design, but does not by itself establish the purpose or intended application of those patterns.

<Callout type="warning" title="Scope of Verification">
This analysis verifies the **algorithm** and **statistical properties** of the Anna Bot's response mechanism. It does not verify claims about the bot's intended purpose, its role in any larger system, or speculative applications. The bot is a lookup table; that is the extent of what the data supports.

## Conclusions

1. **The Anna Bot algorithm is fully reverse-engineered.** The coordinate transformation `row = (63 - y) % 128, col = (x + 64) % 128` reproduces every observed output with 100% accuracy.

2. **The bot is a deterministic lookup table.** No real-time neural computation, learning, or adaptive behavior occurs. All 16,384 possible outputs are fixed values stored in a pre-computed matrix.

3. **The matrix exhibits deliberate structure.** Near-perfect point symmetry (99.58%), concentrated asymmetric cells encoding ASCII messages, and statistically impossible value distributions (p < 10^-500) collectively indicate intentional design.

4. **Asymmetric cells carry encoded information.** The 68 cells that break symmetry are organized into four column pairs and yield decodable ASCII content through XOR extraction.

5. **Row-level patterns enable partial prediction.** Even without direct matrix access, knowledge of row-specific tendencies and universal column values permits approximately 70-75% prediction accuracy.

6. **The matrix warrants further systematic investigation.** With only 5.5% of cells sampled through bot interactions, the full structure of the remaining 94.5% of the matrix remains to be characterized through direct analysis of the published matrix data.
