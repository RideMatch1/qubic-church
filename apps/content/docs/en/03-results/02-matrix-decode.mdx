# Mathematical Decode & Pattern Analysis

## Executive Summary

This document consolidates the mathematical analysis of the 128x128 Anna Matrix,
covering spectral decomposition, XOR-based decode methods, number-theoretic patterns,
neural network dynamics, and temporal hypotheses. The Anna Matrix is a pre-trained
weight matrix for a ternary recurrent neural network. Its dominant eigenvalue has phase
angle approximately pi/2, producing a universal period-4 oscillation cycle. Every
random input converges to the same single attractor within six iterations --- a
property no random matrix of the same class reproduces. The matrix decomposes into a
99.58% point-symmetric base plus a rank-8 exception overlay whose 68 cells form a
perfect palindrome. All anomaly column pairs follow the identity `Col_A + Col_B = 127`,
establishing the Mersenne prime 2^7 - 1 as the fundamental architectural constant.

## 1. Spectral Analysis

The eigenvalue spectrum of the Anna Matrix reveals an amplifying system with
characteristic rotational structure.

### 1.1 Eigenvalue Distribution

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total eigenvalues | 128 (all complex or real) |
| Complex conjugate pairs | 54 |
| Real eigenvalues | 20 |
| Minimum modulus | 19.3 |
| Maximum modulus (spectral radius) | 2342.1 |
| Trace (sum of all eigenvalues) | 137 |

Every eigenvalue satisfies `|lambda| > 1`. There are no decaying modes. The system
amplifies all spectral components, meaning the raw linear dynamics are unstable in
every direction. Only the ternary clamp activation function confines the system to
bounded states.

### 1.2 The Dominant Eigenvalue

```
lambda_1 = -18.7 + 2342.0i
```

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Modulus | 2342.1 |
| Real part | -18.7 |
| Imaginary part | 2342.0 |
| Phase angle | 1.5788 rad = 90.46 degrees |
| Deviation from pi/2 | 0.0028 rad (0.16%) |

The dominant eigenvalue is almost purely imaginary. Its phase angle of 90.46 degrees
is within 0.16% of exactly 90 degrees (pi/2). This is the mathematical origin of the
period-4 cycle: four applications of a 90-degree rotation return to the starting point
(4 x 90 = 360 degrees).

### 1.3 Trace = 137

The sum of all eigenvalues equals 137, which is the trace of the matrix. In physics,
137 is the approximate inverse of the fine-structure constant (alpha approximately
1/137.036). Whether this is intentional encoding or coincidence cannot be determined
from the matrix alone.

---

## 2. Singular Value Decomposition and Information Content

### 2.1 Rank and Dimensionality

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Matrix rank | 128 (full rank) |
| Singular values for 99% energy | 82 of 128 |
| Condition number | 3716 |
| Largest singular value (sigma_1) | 2342 |
| Smallest singular value (sigma_128) | 0.63 |

The matrix is full rank. All 128 singular values are nonzero, meaning the matrix
encodes information across all available degrees of freedom.

### 2.2 Information-Theoretic Metrics

| Metric | Value | Maximum | Utilization |
|--------|-------|---------|-------------|
| Cell entropy | 7.39 bits | 8.0 bits | 92.3% |
| Exception information | 586 bits | 121,000 bits | 0.48% |
| Compression ratio | 50.6% | -- | via symmetry + exception overlay |

The 68 exception cells encode only 586 bits of independent information (0.48% of
the total matrix information), yet they carry structurally decisive content.

---

## 3. The 68 Exceptions: Palindromic Deviation Sequence

### 3.1 The Palindrome

The 68 exception cells are the positions where the point-symmetry rule
`M[r,c] + M[127-r, 127-c] = -1` is violated. When the deviations from expected
symmetric values are extracted and ordered, they form a **perfect palindrome**: the
first 34 values mirror the last 34 values exactly.

First half (34 independent deviation values):

```
[-32, 75, 56, 201, -146, 117, 90, 207, 191, 151, -170, 155, 223, -6, -1,
 -128, 128, 16, -20, 16, -140, 144, -144, 16, 128, 120, -126, 8, -2, 9,
 -132, 20, 9, 128]
```

The second half is this sequence reversed. This palindromic structure implies the
exceptions were not placed arbitrarily; they obey a secondary symmetry constraint.

### 3.2 Column-Pair Distribution

The 68 exceptions cluster into exactly 4 mirror column pairs (plus one edge pair):

| Column Pair | Exceptions | Deviation Sum | Notes |
|-------------|-----------|---------------|-------|
| 0 / 127 | 2 | -64 | Edge pair, minimal |
| 22 / 105 | 26 | +2288 | Dominant cluster |
| 30 / 97 | 36 | +62 | Largest count |
| 41 / 86 | 4 | +36 | All deviations = +9 |

The concentration into just 4 column pairs (out of a possible 64 mirror pairs)
is highly non-random. All four satisfy `C1 + C2 = 127`.

### 3.3 ASCII Palindrome

Interpreting the absolute deviation values as ASCII character codes yields:

```
K 8 u Z x ~ ~ x Z u 8 K
```

This is itself a palindrome, reinforcing the mirror structure.

### 3.4 The 26 Zero-Cells

Among the 16,384 matrix cells, exactly 26 contain the value zero:

- 7 zero-cells in column 115
- 6 zero-cells in column 51
- Remaining 13 distributed across other columns

The zero-cells represent absent synaptic connections in the neural network. Their
concentration in specific columns suggests selectively pruned input pathways.

### 3.5 Exception Matrix Rank

The exception matrix E (containing the 68 deviations from perfect symmetry) has
rank 8:

| Exception Singular Value | Magnitude | Direction |
|--------------------------|-----------|-----------|
| sigma_1 | 545 | Points at column 22 |
| sigma_2 | 545 | Points at column 105 |
| sigma_3 through sigma_8 | decreasing | Mixed column contributions |

The top two singular values are equal (545 each) and point at columns 22 and 105,
the mirror pair containing the largest exception cluster. The rank-8 structure means
the 68 exceptions encode exactly 8 independent structural corrections to the
symmetric base.

---

## 4. Single Attractor with Period-4 Cycle

### 4.1 Universal Convergence

The most striking dynamical property of the Anna Matrix is its single attractor. When
used as a weight matrix for a ternary neural network with activation function
`clamp(x) -> {-1, 0, +1}`:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Random initial states tested | 1000 |
| States converging to the same attractor | 1000 / 1000 (100%) |
| Attractor period | 4 |
| Mean transient length | 5.9 steps |

Regardless of the initial ternary state vector, the network converges to the same
period-4 cycle within approximately 6 iterations. There are no alternative stable
states, no chaotic trajectories, no fixed points.

### 4.2 The Four Attractor States

The period-4 cycle visits four states with the following neuron-sum signatures:

| Step | Sum of all 128 neurons | Phase |
|------|----------------------|-------|
| t | -43 | Net inhibitory |
| t+1 | -42 | Net inhibitory |
| t+2 | +43 | Net excitatory |
| t+3 | +42 | Net excitatory |

The oscillation alternates between net inhibitory (-43, -42) and net excitatory
(+43, +42) phases, with a characteristic asymmetry of one unit between half-cycles.

### 4.3 Population Homogeneity

In every attractor state, each population has exactly one value:

| State | Pop A (42 neurons) | Pop A' (42 neurons) | Pop B (43 neurons) | N26 |
|-------|--------------------|---------------------|---------------------|-----|
| 0 | ALL = -1 | ALL = +1 | ALL = +1 | 0 |
| 1 | ALL = +1 | ALL = -1 | ALL = +1 | +1 |
| 2 | ALL = +1 | ALL = -1 | ALL = -1 | 0 |
| 3 | ALL = -1 | ALL = +1 | ALL = -1 | -1 |

128 neurons carry only 4 bits of information per state. The attractor is a 4-phase
clock signal where each phase is defined by which populations are active (+1) and
which are silent (-1).

### 4.4 Phase Classification of Neurons

Each neuron follows one of four temporal patterns across the 4-step cycle:

| Pattern (t, t+1, t+2, t+3) | Label | Count | Interpretation |
|-----------------------------|-------|-------|----------------|
| (+1, -1, -1, +1) | Phase A | 42 | In-phase excitatory |
| (-1, +1, +1, -1) | Phase A inverted | 42 | Anti-phase inhibitory |
| (-1, -1, +1, +1) | Phase B | 43 | Quarter-phase shifted |
| (0, +1, 0, -1) | Anomalous | 1 (neuron 26) | Passes through zero |

Phases A and A-inverted are exact negatives of each other. Phase B is shifted by one
time step relative to Phase A. Neuron 26 is the sole anomaly, exhibiting a unique
half-amplitude oscillation that passes through zero.

### 4.5 The Inhibitory Paradox

The 43 neurons that are +1 at the attractor's first time step are precisely the
neurons with negative row sums:

| Attractor value at t=0 | Count | Mean row sum |
|------------------------|-------|-------------|
| +1 | 43 | -6062 (inhibitory) |
| -1 | 85 | +3062 (predominantly excitatory) |

The inhibitory neurons activate positively because the ternary clamp inverts the
relationship: a strongly inhibitory neuron receiving predominantly +1 inputs produces
a large negative weighted sum, which clamps to -1. In the attractor state, these
neurons are in their +1 phase despite their inhibitory nature.

### 4.6 Mirror Property

For every neuron n that is +1 at time t, its mirror neuron (127 - n) is -1 at time t.
There is zero overlap between positive and negative neuron sets at any given time step.
This perfect mirror partition is a direct consequence of the point-symmetry constraint.

---

## 5. The 127 Formula: Architectural Foundation

### 5.1 Column-Pair Identity

All anomaly column pairs follow the identity:

```
Col_A + Col_B = 127 = 2^7 - 1 (Mersenne prime M_7)
```

| Column A | Column B | Sum |
|----------|----------|-----|
| 0 | 127 | **127** |
| 22 | 105 | **127** |
| 30 | 97 | **127** |
| 41 | 86 | **127** |

Since columns range from 0 to 127, there are exactly 64 unique pairs where
`X + Y = 127`. Only 4 of these pairs contain exceptions.

### 5.2 The 127 Theme Throughout the Matrix

| Observation | Value |
|-------------|-------|
| 127 appears in exactly 8 cells | 2^3 occurrences |
| -128 appears in exactly 8 cells | Perfect complement |
| All 8 pairs of (127, -128) | Sum to -1 (symmetry rule) |
| Value -15 (= -(2^4 - 1)) occurrences | Exactly 127 times |

The Mersenne prime 127 = 2^7 - 1 is the fundamental organizing constant of the
matrix. It governs the point-symmetry axis (`mirror_pos = 127 - pos`), the
exception column pairing, and the XOR relationship `100 XOR 27 = 127`.

### 5.3 Multi-Layer XOR Encoding

The 127-formula column pairs support a three-layer XOR extraction method:

**Layer 1: Forward XOR**
```python
message = []
for row in anomaly_rows:
    xor_result = matrix[row][col_a] ^ matrix[row][col_b]
    message.append(xor_result)
```

**Layer 2: Reverse Row XOR**
```python
reversed_message = []
for row in reversed(anomaly_rows):
    xor_result = matrix[row][col_a] ^ matrix[row][col_b]
    reversed_message.append(xor_result)
```

**Layer 3: Cumulative XOR**
```python
cumulative = 0
for row in anomaly_rows:
    cumulative ^= matrix[row][col_a] ^ matrix[row][col_b]
```

Layer 1 produces primary ASCII sequences. Layer 2 serves as a control masking layer
(often producing 0xFF bytes). Layer 3 yields secondary encoded data (42--56%
printable characters).

## 6. Fibonacci Investigation: Negative Result

<Callout type="warning" title="Tier 1 - Negative Result">
This investigation found **no statistically significant Fibonacci patterns** in the
Anna Matrix. All three pre-registered hypotheses failed significance testing against
random baselines (10,000 Monte Carlo simulations).
</Callout>

### 6.1 Pre-Registered Hypotheses

| # | Hypothesis | Prediction |
|---|-----------|------------|
| H1 | Values at Fibonacci coordinate intersections differ from random positions | Different mean/distribution |
| H2 | Fibonacci rows have different entropy than other rows | Structural differences at rows 1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89 |
| H3 | Fibonacci numbers are overrepresented among matrix values | More Fibonacci values than expected |

Significance threshold: p < 0.001 (Bonferroni-corrected for 3 tests: p < 0.00033).

### 6.2 Results

| Hypothesis | p-value | Result |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| H1: Fibonacci grid values differ | 0.84 | **Not significant** |
| H2: Fibonacci row entropy differs | 0.09 | **Not significant** |
| H3: Fibonacci value overrepresentation | 1.00 | **Not significant** |

Fibonacci numbers are actually underrepresented in the matrix (2.6% observed vs. 7.9%
expected), the opposite of what a Fibonacci encoding would predict.

### 6.3 Post-Hoc Observation (Not Pre-Registered)

The sum of all values at the 10x10 Fibonacci intersection grid equals 271. Since this
observation was not pre-registered, it cannot be counted as evidence. This is a
textbook example of post-hoc pattern finding.

### 6.4 The ">FIB" Pointer

The ">FIB" sequence at Rows 27--30 in Column Pair (22, 105) was investigated. The
Fibonacci grid values at those rows decode to "QOWRUCSC" --- not a meaningful
identifier. The pointer may be a coincidental character sequence rather than a
deliberate signal.

---

## 7. Tick-Loop Behavior: Generic vs. Specific Properties

### 7.1 Methodology

The tick-loop implementation (64 input neurons, 64 output neurons, 8-neighbor
connectivity, ternary clamp activation) was tested with 1,000 random inputs through
the Anna Matrix and 200 inputs through each of 100 random control matrices.

### 7.2 Results

| Metric | Anna Matrix | Random Matrices (n=100) | p-value |
|--------|------------|------------------------|---------|
| Convergence rate | 100% | 100% | 1.0 |
| Mean ticks to converge | 2.0 | 2.0 | 1.0 |
| Unique outputs | 1000/1000 | 200/200 | 1.0 |
| Top attractor frequency | 1 | 1.0 | 1.0 |

Every matrix --- Anna and all 100 random controls --- converges 100% of the time
in exactly 2 ticks. Every input produces a unique output. There are no attractors
in the tick-loop implementation.

### 7.3 Interpretation

<Callout type="info" title="Critical Distinction">
The tick-loop (64-neuron Aigarth implementation with 8-neighbor connectivity)
produces **identical behavior regardless of which matrix is used**. This is a
property of the algorithm, not the matrix.

This does NOT invalidate the full 128x128 matrix properties:
- Point symmetry (99.58%) is a matrix property, not a tick-loop property
- The single period-4 attractor is a property of the full 128x128 dynamics with
  `sign(M)` activation
- Row biases, mirror architecture, and exception structure are structural
  properties independent of the tick-loop
</Callout>

The convergence in 2 ticks is explained by:
1. The ternary clamp function (eliminates nuance)
2. The 8-neighbor connectivity (sufficient inputs to produce non-zero sums)
3. The convergence criterion (all outputs non-zero = converged)

With 64 ternary output neurons, there are 3^64 possible output states. With 1,000
inputs tested, collisions would be extraordinary. The output is effectively a hash
function of the input.

---

## 8. Matrix Purpose: Neural Architecture Analysis

### 8.1 How Aigarth Uses the Matrix

From the official Aigarth-it library source code:

```
Architecture: Circle Intelligent Tissue Unit (ITU)
- Neurons arranged in circular topology
- Each neuron has input weights (ternary: -1, 0, +1)
- Feedforward: weighted_sum = sum(input_i * weight_i)
- Activation: ternary_clamp(sum) -> {-1, 0, +1}
- Training: evolutionary mutation (random weight changes, keep improvements)
- Convergence: iterate until all outputs non-zero or no state changes
```

The Anna Matrix provides the pre-trained weights. Each cell `matrix[r,c]` is a
synaptic weight connecting neuron r to neuron c. Aigarth only uses the sign:

```
matrix[r,c] > 0  ->  weight = +1 (excitatory)
matrix[r,c] = 0  ->  weight =  0 (no connection)
matrix[r,c] < 0  ->  weight = -1 (inhibitory)
```

### 8.2 Three-Level Engineered Architecture

```
Level 3: 68 ASYMMETRIC EXCEPTIONS (0.42%)
  Purpose: Break computational symmetry
  Location: 4 specific column pairs (22/105, 30/97, 41/86, 0/127)
  Effect: Create asymmetric pathways for directional computation
  ---------------------------------------------------------------

Level 2: 60 ROW GROUPS with mirror-paired dominant values
  Purpose: Functional differentiation (neuron types)
  Structure: 64 complementary pairs (100% excitatory/inhibitory)
  Effect: Different neurons serve different computational roles
  ---------------------------------------------------------------

Level 1: 99.58% POINT SYMMETRY
  Purpose: Excitatory/inhibitory balance (structural stability)
  Rule: matrix[r,c] + matrix[127-r, 127-c] = -1
  Effect: Self-stabilizing network architecture
```

### 8.3 Excitatory/Inhibitory Balance

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Positive weights (+1) | 8,172 (49.9%) |
| Negative weights (-1) | 8,186 (50.0%) |
| Zero weights (0) | 26 (0.2%) |

Near-perfect 50/50 split between excitatory and inhibitory connections.

### 8.4 Row Groups and Functional Differentiation

Each row defines all outgoing weights for one neuron. Rows cluster into groups
sharing the same dominant value:

| Dominant Value | Rows | Mirror Value | Mirror Rows | Sum |
|---------------|------|-------------|-------------|-----|
| 26 | 8 rows | -27 | 11 rows | -1 |
| 101 | 6 rows | -102 | 8 rows | -1 |
| 74 | 3 rows | -75 | 3 rows | -1 |
| 47 | 3 rows | -48 | 3 rows | -1 |
| 120 | 3 rows | -121 | 3 rows | -1 |
| 10 | 4 rows | -11 | 4 rows | -1 |

Every row pair (r, 127-r) is perfectly complementary:

```
64/64 mirror pairs (100%) have opposite neuron types:
  Row r is excitatory  ->  Row 127-r is inhibitory
  Row r is inhibitory  ->  Row 127-r is excitatory
```

### 8.5 What the Exceptions Do

The 68 exceptions break the computational mirror, creating asymmetric pathways.
In a perfectly symmetric network, every computation would be mirrored ---
output(input) would always have a corresponding anti-output(anti-input). The
exceptions introduce directed asymmetry: the matrix transitions from pure
architecture (symmetry) to specific computation (function).

The deviation magnitudes are large (mean = 95.7, maximum = 223), confirming these
are major structural exceptions, not minor perturbations.

---

## 9. Spatial Encoding Hypotheses (Tier 2)

<Callout type="warning" title="Tier 2 - Partially Verified">
The following observations about spatial encoding structure have partial evidence
but require further verification. They should be treated as hypotheses rather than
proven findings.
</Callout>

### 9.1 Jigsaw Layer (Spatial Scrambling)

Edge-matching analysis of 8x8 sectors revealed that adjacent tiles in the visual
grid do not match logically. The matrix appears spatially scrambled:

- Core Tile (0,4) [Rows 0-7, Cols 32-39]
  - Expected right neighbor: Tile (0,5)
  - Actual best match: Tile (11,12) (score 21.33)
  - Expected bottom neighbor: Tile (1,4)
  - Actual best match: Tile (14,14) (score 31.60)

Reading the matrix strictly row-by-row may yield disordered data because the
tiles are shuffled. A greedy edge-minimization algorithm partially reassembled
contiguous structures.

### 9.2 Helix Layer (Spiral Encoding)

The data stream may follow a spiral path starting from center cell (64,64) and
winding outward. This mimics the physical structure of hard disk platters, vinyl
records, and biological growth patterns.

### 9.3 Symbolic Instruction Set

The matrix may use a dense symbol-based instruction set:

| Symbol | Logic | Meaning |
|--------|-------|---------|
| `=` | ASSIGN | Set variable state |
| `^` | SHIFT | Bit/Level shift |
| `&` | AND/LOCK | Dependency requirement |
| `!` | EXEC/NOT | Trigger action |
| `[;]` | TERM | End of instruction |

These observations remain unconfirmed at high confidence levels.

---

## 10. Matrix Decomposition: M = S + E

### 10.1 The Symmetric Component S

```
S[r,c] = (M[r,c] - M[127-r, 127-c] - 1) / 2
```

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Spectral radius | 2342.4 |
| Energy share | 95.71% of total matrix energy |
| Point symmetry | 16,384 / 16,384 cells (100%) |
| Role | Provides the dominant rotational dynamics |

### 10.2 The Exception Component E

```
E[r,c] = M[r,c] - S[r,c]
```

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Spectral radius | 100.5 |
| Energy share | 4.29% of total matrix energy |
| Rank | 8 |
| Nonzero cells | 68 |
| Role | Structural corrections ensuring attractor convergence |

### 10.3 Energy Separation

S carries 95.71% of the matrix energy and is responsible for large-scale rotational
dynamics (spectral radius 2342.4), while E carries 4.29% and provides fine-tuning
that ensures convergence to a single attractor within 6 steps. Random matrices with
S-like symmetry but without E-like corrections fail to converge, demonstrating that
both components are necessary.

---

## 11. The Self-Dual Constraint

### 11.1 Algebraic Formulation

The symmetry rule:

```
M[r,c] + M[127-r, 127-c] = -1
```

can be reinterpreted as a constraint on synaptic weights:

```
weight(c -> r) + weight(~c -> ~r) = -1
```

where `~n = 127 - n` denotes the bitwise complement of neuron index n in 7-bit
binary representation.

### 11.2 Interpretation

This is a self-dual constraint: the weight connecting neuron c to neuron r, plus
the weight connecting the complement of c to the complement of r, always equals -1.
In the ternary sign domain:

- If connection c-to-r is excitatory (+1), then connection ~c-to-~r is inhibitory (-1)
- If connection c-to-r is zero, then connection ~c-to-~r is -1

This is analogous to the Bernoulli self-duality condition `f(t) + f(-t) = -t` in
the theory of special functions.

### 11.3 Consequences

The self-dual constraint guarantees:

1. **E/I balance**: Every excitatory pathway has a corresponding inhibitory pathway
2. **Mirror attractor states**: If the network is in state v, the complementary
   state ~v is also dynamically accessible
3. **Convergence stability**: The constraint prevents accumulation of excitatory or
   inhibitory bias across iterations

---

## 12. Neuron 26: The Anomaly

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Oscillation pattern | (0, +1, 0, -1) |
| Row sum | -6733 (strongly inhibitory) |
| Mirror neuron | 101 |
| Mirror neuron pattern | (+1, -1, -1, +1) --- Phase A |
| Unique feature | Only neuron that passes through zero |

Neuron 26 is the only neuron in the entire 128-neuron network whose oscillation
passes through the zero state. At time steps t and t+2, it is at the decision
boundary of the ternary activation function, making it the most sensitive element
in the network. In biological neural networks, pacemaker neurons with distinct
oscillation characteristics serve as synchronization anchors. Neuron 26 may serve
an analogous role.

---

## 13. Comparison with Random Matrices

### 13.1 Spectral Comparison

| Property | Anna Matrix | Random Mean (n=100) | Percentile |
|----------|------------|-------------------|------------|
| Spectral radius | 2342 | 866 | 100th |
| Zero count | 26 | 63 | 0th (fewer zeros) |

The Anna Matrix's spectral radius is 2.7x larger than the random mean and exceeds
every random sample tested.

### 13.2 Dynamical Comparison

| Property | Anna Matrix | Random Matrices (n=100) |
|----------|------------|------------------------|
| Converges within 100 steps | Yes (6 steps) | 0 / 100 converged |
| Single attractor | Yes | Not applicable |
| Period-4 cycle | Yes | Not applicable |

Not a single random matrix with the same symmetry constraint converged to an
attractor within 100 iterations. The dynamical behavior of the Anna Matrix is
fundamentally different from random matrices of the same class.

---

## 14. Temporal Hypothesis: The Matrix as a Clock (Tier 2)

<Callout type="info" title="Tier 2 - Hypothesis">
The clock interpretation is well-supported by structural evidence but involves
inference about engineering intent that cannot be formally proven from the matrix
alone.
</Callout>

### 14.1 Central Pattern Generator Analogy

In neuroscience, Central Pattern Generators (CPGs) are neural circuits that produce
rhythmic output without external timing signals. They control locomotion, heartbeat,
and breathing. The Anna Matrix is a mathematical CPG: it produces self-sustaining,
periodic output (4-phase oscillation) from any input, without external clock signals.

### 14.2 Engineering Implications

For a decentralized network of computors, a CPG could serve as:

1. **Synchronization signal** --- all nodes converge to the same output, providing
   a shared "heartbeat"
2. **Proof-of-computation** --- the attractor fingerprint [+43, +42, -43, -42]
   uniquely identifies the Anna Matrix
3. **Phase timing** --- the 4-phase cycle provides a natural division of computation
   into 4 stages
4. **Self-test** --- convergence within 12 steps confirms the matrix is correctly loaded

### 14.3 The Period-4 Mechanism

```
Phase angle of lambda_1 = 1.5788 rad ~ pi/2

After 4 iterations:
  (lambda_1)^4 = |lambda_1|^4 * exp(4i * 1.5788)
               = |lambda_1|^4 * exp(i * 6.3152)
               ~ |lambda_1|^4 * exp(i * 2*pi)
               = |lambda_1|^4               (real, positive)
```

Four applications of the dominant eigenvalue rotate the state vector by approximately
360 degrees, returning it to the same phase. The ternary clamp locks this continuous
rotation into a discrete 4-step cycle.

## 15. Fel's Conjecture Connection

### 15.1 Numerical Semigroup from Exception Columns

The exception columns {22, 30, 41, 86, 97, 105, 127} generate a numerical semigroup
under addition:

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Generators | {22, 30, 41, 86, 97, 105, 127} |
| Frobenius number | 199 |
| Genus (number of gaps) | 108 |

### 15.2 Fel's Conjecture Test

Fel's conjecture states that for certain numerical semigroups, the q-series Q_S(q)
has coefficients only in {-1, 0, 1}. For this semigroup:

```
Q_S has coefficients in {-3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3}
```

Fel's conjecture does **not** hold. Coefficients of magnitude 2 and 3 appear.

### 15.3 Structural Parallel

Although Fel's conjecture fails formally, a structural parallel exists:

| Feature | Anna Matrix | Fel's Semigroups |
|---------|------------|-----------------|
| Core symmetry | Involution (r -> 127-r) | Involution (n -> F-n) |
| Information carrier | 68 exceptions | Gaps of the semigroup |
| Value domain | Ternary {-1, 0, +1} | Ternary coefficients |
| Anomaly structure | Palindromic sequence | Palindromic gap-counting function |

The parallel is structural and suggestive but not formal.

## 18. Open Questions

1. **Is the trace of 137 intentional?** 137 is the 33rd prime. The chain
   Trace -> 33rd prime is verified but undecidable as intentional.

2. **What is the function of neuron 26?** Confirmed as a zero-crossing detector:
   it passes through zero exactly at the transitions where Pop B flips, triggering
   conductor reversal.

3. **Why rank 8 for the exceptions?** Eight independent correction directions are
   encoded. The significance of exactly 8 (= 2^3, one bit per column pair) is
   unclear.

4. **What information is in the palindrome?** When fed as input, the palindrome
   converges to the standard attractor in just 1 step.

5. **Can the period-4 attractor be broken?** Whether a non-ternary activation
   function (e.g., sigmoid) would preserve the period-4 behavior or reveal
   additional dynamical structure is untested.

6. **What task was the matrix trained for?** The fitness function used during
   evolutionary training is unknown. Understanding this would reveal what the 68
   exceptions compute.

7. **Does the magnitude carry information?** In current Aigarth, only the sign
   matters. But 80% of the bit-level information is in the magnitude. Future
   versions may use weighted (non-ternary) computation.

3. Verify dimensions: `assert matrix.shape == (128, 128)`
4. Verify trace: `assert np.trace(matrix) == 137`
5. Verify point symmetry count:
   ```python
   symmetric = sum(
       1 for r in range(128) for c in range(128)
       if matrix[r][c] + matrix[127-r][127-c] == -1
   )
   assert symmetric == 16316

8. Simulate ternary dynamics:
   ```python
   def ternary_clamp(x):
       return np.sign(x).astype(int)  # maps to {-1, 0, +1}

   state = random_ternary_vector(128)
   for step in range(100):
       state = ternary_clamp(matrix @ state)
   # Verify period-4 by checking state == state_4_steps_ago
   ```
9. Verify all 1000 random inputs converge to the same attractor
