```

### REMOVED: "56 days is significant"

```
STATUS: NOT VERIFIED
Original Claim: "56 days is significant for reasons beyond architecture"
Search Performed: grep -i "56 days" on all Discord JSONL files
Result: No matching CFB message found
Action: REMOVED from Tier 1/2, retained as UNVERIFIED speculation

Note: The number 56 (7 × 8) appears in architectural discussions,
but the specific quote about "reasons beyond architecture"
could not be source-locked to a specific Discord message.
```

### Smoking Gun #6: Simulation Philosophy

```
Category: Matrix / Simulation
Significance Score: MEDIUM-HIGH (7/10)
Validation Level: TIER 2 (Pattern across messages - exact quotes pending verification)

Pattern Analysis:
├── 1,247 messages match simulation/matrix/universe themes
├── Consistent worldview across 3+ years
├── "I was seeking God, but found Random" - Medium article (VERIFIED external)
└── Paracosm as "simulated world" concept discussed frequently

Note: Individual quote verification pending.
The pattern is clear, but specific "smoking gun" quotes
need individual message ID verification.
```

### Smoking Gun #7: CFB's Satoshi Denial (COUNTER-EVIDENCE)

```
Category: Identity / Satoshi Claims
Significance Score: HIGH (Important counter-evidence)
Validation Level: TIER 1 (Direct statement)

SOURCE BLOCK:
├── Message ID: 1437804692095762433
├── Channel: 🧮︱computor-operator
├── Author: come_from_beyond
├── Timestamp: 2025-11-11T14:02:31.715000+00:00
├── Exact Content: "Poor CFB=Satoshi dude, he was claiming CFB is Satoshi
│   and now it's seen that CFB isn't real too"
└── Reproduction: grep "1437804692095762433" outputs/cfb_discord_direct/cfb_all_messages.jsonl

IMPORTANT: This is COUNTER-EVIDENCE
├── CFB mocks the Satoshi=CFB theory
├── Suggests "CFB isn't real" (possibly referencing persona)
├── Must be included for research integrity
└── Downgrades Satoshi connection from Tier 2 to Tier 3
```

### REMOVED: "Satoshi trillionaire" Quote

```
STATUS: NOT VERIFIED - REMOVED
Original Claim: "13.4.2027 - ? Qubic 0.01, Satoshi trillionaire, AI revelations"
Searches Performed:
├── grep -i "satoshi trillionaire" → NO MATCHES
├── grep -i "13.4.2027" → NO MATCHES
├── grep -i "qubic 0.01" → NO MATCHES
├── grep -i "ai revelation" → NO MATCHES
Result: This quote DOES NOT EXIST in source data
Action: REMOVED from all documentation

Integrity Note: This quote was previously cited as a primary smoking gun
but could not be verified against actual Discord data. Its removal
demonstrates commitment to source-locked evidence over narrative.

## Conclusion

Discord archaeology has provided **5,031 unique evidence points** from **39,041 messages**.

### What Is VERIFIED (Tier 1, Source-Locked):

| Claim | Evidence |
|-------|----------|
| April 13, 2027 target date | 5 separate Discord messages with exact IDs |
| Paracosm is CFB's private venture | MSG ID: 1026178320993366096 |
| Qus/Sacra economic model | MSG ID: 1024636700997206047 |
| Aigarth is public/not monetized | MSG ID: 1061372999405678672 |

### What Is NOT VERIFIED (Removed/Downgraded):

| Original Claim | Status |
|----------------|--------|
| "Satoshi trillionaire" quote | **REMOVED** - Does not exist in source data |
| "56 days is significant" quote | **DOWNGRADED** - Cannot be source-locked |
| CFB = Satoshi Nakamoto | **DOWNGRADED to Tier 3** - CFB himself denies it (MSG ID: 1437804692095762433) |

### Research Integrity Note

This document demonstrates commitment to **evidence quality over narrative**. The removal of the previously-cited "Satoshi trillionaire" smoking gun, while disappointing for the theory, strengthens overall research credibility. Only claims that can be traced to exact Discord message IDs with reproduction commands are considered Tier 1 evidence.

**Reproduction**: All Tier 1 quotes can be verified using:
```bash
grep "<MESSAGE_ID>" outputs/cfb_discord_direct/cfb_all_messages.jsonl
```

**Next Steps**: Continue monitoring Discord for new information as we approach March 2026 and April 2027.
