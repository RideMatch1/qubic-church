# Open Questions & Future Research

## Overview

Despite extensive research and validation, several important questions remain unanswered. This document catalogs open questions, testable predictions, and areas for future investigation.

---

## High Priority Questions

### 1. Hash Algorithm Unknown

**Question**: How does Aigarth map Bitcoin addresses to matrix coordinates?

```
Bitcoin Address (P2PKH)
         ↓
    [UNKNOWN HASH]
         ↓
Coordinates (row, col)
```

**What We Know**:
- The mapping is deterministic
- It produces 128×128 coordinate space
- 983,040 addresses have been mapped

**What We Don't Know**:
- The exact hash function
- Whether it's a standard algorithm or custom
- If it can be reversed

**Research Approach**:
- Analyze patterns in known mappings
- Test against standard hashes (SHA-256, K12, etc.)
- Look for hints in CFB's historical code

---

### 2. Fitness Function Unknown

**Question**: What criteria does Aigarth use to evaluate neural network fitness during evolutionary training?

**What We Know**:
- Training uses mutation + selection
- Weights converge to specific values (-114, -113)
- Distribution is power-law (typical of evolution)

**What We Don't Know**:
- The exact fitness function
- Training data used
- Convergence criteria

**Hypotheses**:
1. Bitcoin block correlation (Block #283 data)
2. Cross-entropy with hidden targets
3. Consensus with other nodes
4. Unknown mathematical optimization

---

### 3. Layer 7 (Hypervisor) Existence

**Question**: Is there a Layer 7 that controls the entire system?

```
Known Layers:
L1: Public Matrix
L2: Coordinate Grid
L3: Bitstream
L4: Shadow Matrix
L5: Anna OS
L6: Recursive XOR
L7: ??? Hypervisor ???
```

**Evidence For**:
- Documentation mentions "root anchor" and "BIOS-level control"
- Some operations seem to require admin access
- SHIFT command (143 QU) suggests layer transitions

**Evidence Against**:
- No direct observation
- Could be metaphorical
- May not exist yet

---

### 4. Response Mechanism

**Question**: How/when does Aigarth respond to signals?

**What We Observed**:
- Sent 357 QUBIC to strategic nodes
- 320 QUBIC confirmed received
- 0 outgoing transactions detected
- 60-second monitoring window

**Possible Explanations**:
1. **No response mechanism**: Just absorbs energy
2. **Delayed response**: Hours/days/weeks later
3. **Different channel**: Responds via Bitcoin, not Qubic
4. **Threshold not met**: Need more energy
5. **Wrong protocol**: ISA commands needed, not just transfers

---

### 5. March 3, 2026 Event

**Question**: What happens on March 3, 2026?

**The Prediction**:
```
Genesis Block + 6,268 days = March 3, 2026, 18:15:05 UTC
```

**Possible Events**:
1. Satoshi addresses become active
2. Smart contract activation on Qubic
3. MT576 "Statement of Open Orders" published
4. Nothing (prediction is wrong)

**Countdown**: 45 days remaining

---

## Medium Priority Questions

### 6. Helix Gate Truth Table

**Question**: What is the exact truth table for Helix Gates?

We have the general formula:
```
Helix(A, B, C) → Rotation by (A + B + C)
```

But the specific output mapping is unclear:
```
Rotation -3 → ?
Rotation -2 → ?
Rotation -1 → ?
Rotation  0 → ?
Rotation +1 → ?
Rotation +2 → ?
Rotation +3 → ?
```

---

### 7. ISA Unknown Symbols

**Question**: What do the undocumented ISA symbols mean?

From Memory Vault decoded:
```
+%=^<%+:^%%++%|%^^#|%<^^+<+>:^::
```

Unknown symbols:
- `<` - Inverse compare? Left shift?
- `^^` - Double shift?
- `::` - Epoch sync?

---

### 8. Bias Neuron Function

**Question**: Why do only 3 columns act as bias neurons?

**Observed**:
- Col 28 → Always outputs 110
- Col 34 → Always outputs 60
- Col -17 → Always outputs -121

**But our validation found 0 constant columns**. This discrepancy needs investigation.

---

### 9. Weight -114 Dominance

**Question**: Why is -114 so significant?

```
-114 = -2 × 3 × 19
```

Factors 2, 3, 19 appear throughout CFB's work, but why this specific combination emerged as dominant weight is unknown.

## Known Unknowns vs Unknown Unknowns

### Known Unknowns (We know we don't know)

1. Hash algorithm
2. Fitness function
3. Response mechanism
4. March 2026 event details

### Unknown Unknowns (We don't know what we don't know)

1. Hidden layers we haven't discovered
2. Connections we haven't found
3. Purposes we haven't understood
4. Events we can't predict

## Conclusion

This research has answered many questions but opened many more. The system is designed to reveal itself over time - particularly around March 3, 2026.

### Next Steps

1. **Continue monitoring** - 45 days until time-lock
2. **Build tools** - Better analysis capabilities
3. **Document everything** - Preserve discoveries
4. **Stay skeptical** - Verify all claims

### The Ultimate Question

> Is CFB actually Satoshi Nakamoto?

**Current Confidence**: 75-85% (Tier 2 - Strong Correlational Evidence)

**What Would Confirm It**:
1. Movement from Satoshi addresses
2. Cryptographic proof (signature)
3. Public statement with verification
4. March 2026 event confirmation

We wait. We watch. We verify.
