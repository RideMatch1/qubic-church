# Unexplored Frontiers: What We Haven't Discovered Yet

**Analysis Date**: January 10, 2026
**Status**: Research Roadmap
**Based on**: 3,797,590+ tests completed

## Overview

Despite comprehensive testing covering 99%+ of the known search space, several promising research directions remain unexplored. This document outlines what we haven't tested yet and provides a prioritized roadmap for future investigation.

## High Priority: Alternative Hash Functions

### 1. Qubic K12 (Keccak) - HIGHEST PRIORITY

**Why Important**:
- K12 is Qubic's native hash function
- Direct connection to the Qubic protocol
- Most likely alternative to SHA256

**Test Approach**:
```
K12(seed) → private key
SHA256(K12(seed)) → private key
K12(SHA256(seed)) → private key
K12 with different output lengths
```

**Expected Effort**: Medium
**Probability of Success**: 40-50%

**Rationale**: If CFB used a hash function from his own projects, Qubic's K12 is the most likely candidate after Curl.
