## 4. The Resonance Formula

### How Resonance is Calculated

Each node has a characteristic frequency based on its matrix position and value. The resonance between nodes is:

```
R(n₁, n₂) = 1 - (|V₁ - V₂| × D(n₁, n₂)) / (V_max × D_max)
```

Where:
- V₁, V₂ = Matrix values at node positions
- D(n₁, n₂) = Euclidean distance between nodes
- V_max = Maximum matrix value (255)
- D_max = Maximum diagonal distance (181.02)

### Simplified Formula

For practical calculation:

```
R = 100 × (1 - (ΔV × ΔD) / 46,161)
```

Where:
- ΔV = Absolute value difference
- ΔD = Distance between nodes
- 46,161 = 255 × 181.02 (normalization constant)

### Network Resonance

The total network resonance is the average of all node-pair resonances:

```
R_network = (2 / N(N-1)) × Σ R(nᵢ, nⱼ)  for all i < j
```

For 11 nodes: 2/(11 × 10) = 1/55 times the sum of 55 unique pairs.

### Key Derivation Method

All private keys are derived using the standardized process:

```
1. Matrix Position → Coordinate bytes
2. Matrix Value → Value bytes
3. Qubic Seed → K12 hash
4. Combine: Position || Value || K12(Seed)
5. SHA256 → 256-bit private key
6. ECDSA secp256k1 → Public key
7. RIPEMD160(SHA256(pubkey)) → Address
```

## 7. Operational Implications

### For Bridge Activation

1. **Entry Validation**: All incoming transactions must pass through ENTRY node validation
2. **Core Processing**: CORE must maintain >50% resonance for operations
3. **Root Synchronization**: Both ROOT-ALPHA and ROOT-BETA must be SYNCED
4. **Temporal Gate**: DATE node must reach activation time (March 3, 2026)

### Security Considerations

<Callout type="warning" title="Security Notice">
The private keys documented here are for research purposes. Production deployment requires fresh key generation with proper entropy sources.
</Callout>

### Redundancy Design

The 11-node architecture provides:
- **2x Root Redundancy**: ROOT-ALPHA and ROOT-BETA mirror each other
- **Entry/Exit Separation**: Independent validation at both ends
- **Memory Persistence**: State survives network interruptions
- **Oracle Integration**: External data feeds for validation
