# Study Objectives

## Primary Research Objectives

This investigation pursues three principal objectives, each with defined success criteria and measurable outcomes.

### Objective 1: Validate the Formula

**Statement**: Determine whether mathematical relationships exist between Bitcoin blockchain values and Qubic matrix coordinates that exceed chance expectations.

**Specific Tests**:

1. **Modulo 121 Analysis**
   - Test: Calculate timestamp mod 121 for Pre-Genesis block
   - Success criterion: Result equals a Qubic architectural constant
   - Observed result: 1221069728 mod 121 = 43 (Qubic prime)

2. **Modulo 43 Analysis**
   - Test: Calculate block-to-matrix mappings using mod 43 operations
   - Success criterion: Consistent patterns across multiple blocks
   - Observed result: Cluster gaps average exactly 43.5

3. **Modulo 27 Analysis**
   - Test: Map blocks divisible by 27 to matrix cells
   - Success criterion: Sum produces recognizable value
   - Observed result: Sum = 177 = 0xB1 = Pre-Genesis hash byte

**Quantitative Threshold**: Combined probability of results p < 0.001

### Objective 2: Map the Matrix

**Statement**: Create a comprehensive mapping between Anna Matrix positions and Bitcoin blockchain artifacts.

**Specific Deliverables**:

1. **Cell-to-Block Mapping**
   ```
   Matrix[row][col] → Block(s) related to position
   ```

2. **Value-to-Address Mapping**
   ```
   Cell value → Associated Bitcoin address(es)
   ```

3. **Pattern Identification**
   ```
   Helix patterns → Corresponding blockchain structures
   ```

**Success Criteria**:

| Mapping Type | Minimum Coverage | Target Coverage |
|-------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Cell-to-Block | 10% of cells | 50% of cells |
| Value-to-Address | 100 addresses | 1,000 addresses |
| Pattern matches | 50 patterns | 500 patterns |

### Objective 3: Decode the Time-Lock

**Statement**: Identify and analyze temporal encoding mechanisms within the data structures.

**Specific Investigations**:

1. **Anniversary Correlations**
   - September 10 recurrence patterns
   - 11-year and 15-year intervals
   - Future predicted events

2. **Timestamp Modulo Cycles**
   - When does timestamp mod 121 = 43 recur?
   - What dates align with significant modulo values?

3. **Duration Calculations**
   - Pre-Genesis to Genesis: 115.01 days
   - Pre-Genesis to Aigarth: 11.00 years
   - Pre-Genesis to predicted unlock: 17.5 years

**Success Criterion**: Identification of at least one future date with mathematical significance supported by p < 0.01.

## Secondary Objectives

### Objective 4: Establish Verification Protocol

- Independent verification of findings
- Extension to additional datasets
- Application to similar research questions

### Objective 5: Document Code Style Indicators

## Limitations and Scope

### What This Research Cannot Determine

| Question | Status | Reason |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Personal identity of authors | Out of scope | Ethical and methodological constraints |
| Legal implications | Out of scope | Not a legal analysis |
| Investment recommendations | Out of scope | Not financial advice |
| Absolute certainty | Impossible | Science deals in probabilities |

### Methodological Limitations

1. **Historical data gaps**: Pre-2009 development records are incomplete
2. **Selection effects**: Patterns noticed retrospectively may be biased
3. **Independence assumptions**: Combined probabilities assume independence
4. **Small samples**: Some analyses have limited statistical power

### Alternative Hypotheses Considered

- Coincidental alignment of mathematical constants
- Common cryptographic conventions producing similar structures
- Post-hoc pattern recognition (apophenia)
- Deliberate misdirection or false trail

## Conclusion

The objectives outlined in this section provide a structured framework for investigating the Qubic-Bitcoin connection hypothesis. By establishing clear success criteria, measurable outcomes, and explicit limitations, we ensure that conclusions are based on quantifiable evidence rather than subjective interpretation.

The subsequent Methods section details the specific analytical techniques employed to achieve these objectives.
