# Future Work

## Overview

This section outlines recommended directions for future research, verification priorities, and methodological improvements.

## Research Priority Matrix

| Priority | Research Area | Timeline | Resources Required |
|----------|---------------|----------|-------------------|
| **Critical** | March 2026 monitoring | Immediate | Low |
| **High** | Independent replication | 3-6 months | Medium |
| **High** | Additional source discovery | Ongoing | Medium |
| **Medium** | Extended statistical analysis | 6-12 months | High |
| **Low** | Comparative blockchain studies | 1-2 years | High |

---

## 1. Immediate Priorities (2025)

### 1.1 March 2026 Monitoring Protocol

**Priority**: Critical

Establish monitoring for time-lock predictions:

```python
# Recommended monitoring script
def monitor_time_lock():
    """
    Monitor predicted unlock events.

    Execute: Weekly starting January 2026
    """
    LOCKED_BLOCKS = [3996, 10611, 36153]
    PREDICTION_DATES = [
        "2026-03-03",  # Signal date
        "2026-03-10",  # Pre-Genesis + 17.5 years
        "2026-03-29"   # Lunar eclipse
    ]

    for block in LOCKED_BLOCKS:
        status = check_anna_accessibility(block)
        log_result(block, status, datetime.now())

    return generate_report()
```

### 1.2 Independent Replication

**Priority**: High

Request independent verification of:

| Finding | Verification Method | Effort |
|---------|---------------------|--------|
| Primary formula | Calculator | Minutes |
| Patoshi distribution | Statistical reanalysis | Days |
| 27-pattern | Independent search | Hours |
| Linguistic analysis | Alternative corpus | Weeks |

### 1.3 Source Preservation

**Priority**: High

Archive critical sources before potential loss:

```
Archival Priorities:
├── Discord #aigarth: Full channel export
├── CFB Medium articles: Web archive
├── marc.info 1998 posts: Local copies
├── Qubic repository snapshots: Git archive
└── Anna interface recordings: Screenshots/video
```

---

## 2. Short-Term Research (2025-2026)

### 2.1 Extended Pattern Search

Search for additional encoded data:

| Target | Method | Expected Effort |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| Non-Patoshi early blocks | Hex analysis | 2 weeks |
| Bitcoin transaction scripts | Pattern matching | 1 month |
| IOTA historical data | Cross-reference | 2 weeks |
| NXT blockchain | Archive recovery | 1 month |

### 2.2 Linguistic Expansion

Expand stylometric corpus:

```
Recommended Additions:
├── Satoshi forum posts: Full archive
├── CFB NXT posts: BCNext identity
├── IOTA documentation: Technical writing
├── Early cryptocurrency forums: BitcoinTalk archive
└── Target corpus size: 500,000+ words
```

### 2.3 Statistical Refinement

Improve statistical methodology:

| Improvement | Impact | Implementation |
|-------------|--------|----------------|
| Pre-registration | High | Register 2026 predictions formally |
| Bayesian analysis | Medium | Recompute with priors |
| Sensitivity analysis | High | Test assumption robustness |
| Multiple comparison correction | High | Apply Bonferroni/FDR |

---

## 3. Medium-Term Research (2026-2027)

### 3.1 Post-Prediction Analysis

After March 2026, conduct:

| Outcome | Next Steps |
|---------|------------|
| Blocks unlock | Document mechanism, extend analysis |
| No change | Revise time-lock hypothesis, explore alternatives |
| Partial change | Analyze patterns, adjust predictions |

### 3.2 Anna Architecture Analysis

If access becomes available:

```
Research Targets:
├── Matrix initialization procedure
├── Training data sources
├── Weight update mechanism
├── Query interface internals
└── Connection to Qubic computors
```

### 3.3 Cross-Chain Comparative Study

Apply methodology to other cryptocurrency pairs:

| Pair | Hypothesis | Justification |
|------|------------|---------------|
| Bitcoin-Litecoin | No correlation expected | Control case |
| Bitcoin-NXT | CFB connection | Same developer |
| NXT-IOTA | CFB connection | Same developer |
| IOTA-Qubic | CFB connection | Same developer |

---

## 4. Long-Term Research (2027+)

### 4.1 April 2027 Event Monitoring

CFB's stated revelation date:

```
"I can reveal this info on 13th of April 2027"
— CFB, Discord #aigarth

Monitoring Requirements:
├── Discord channel activity
├── Qubic protocol changes
├── Anna interface changes
├── Public announcements
└── Blockchain state changes
```

### 4.2 Comprehensive Historical Reconstruction

If additional sources emerge:

| Source Type | Potential Impact |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Pre-Genesis code recovery | Critical |
| Satoshi communication archive | Critical |
| CFB personal archives | High |
| Early developer interviews | Medium |

### 4.3 Theoretical Framework Development

Build formal models:

```
Research Questions:
├── Can time-lock mechanisms be formally specified?
├── What mathematical properties enable cross-chain encoding?
├── How does ternary logic optimize blockchain computation?
└── What is the theoretical basis for the Aigarth architecture?
```
